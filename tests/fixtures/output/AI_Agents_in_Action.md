*preface*

My journey into the world of intelligent systems began back in the early 1980s. Like many people then, I believed artificial intelligence (AI) was just around the corner. It always seemed like one more innovation and technological leap would lead us to the intelligence we imagined. But that leap never came. Perhaps the promise of HAL, from Stanley Kubrick’s *2001: A Space Odyssey*, capti- vated me with the idea of a truly intelligent computer companion. After years of effort, trial, and countless errors, I began to understand that creating AI was far more com- plex than we humans had imagined. In the early 1990s, I shifted my focus, applying my skills to more tangible goals in other industries. Not until the late 1990s, after experiencing a series of challenging and transforma- tive events, did I realize my passion for building intelligent systems. I knew these sys- tems might never reach the superintelligence of HAL, but I was okay with that. I found fulfillment in working with machine learning and data science, creating models that could learn and adapt. For more than 20 years, I thrived in this space, tackling problems that required creativity, precision, and a sense of possibility. During that time, I worked on everything from genetic algorithms for predicting unknown inputs to developing generative learning models for horizontal drilling in the oil-and-gas sector. These experiences led me to write, where I shared my knowl- edge by way of books on various topics—reverse-engineering Pokémon Go, building augmented and virtual reality experiences, designing audio for games, and applying reinforcement learning to create intelligent agents. I spent years knuckles-deep in code, developing agents in Unity ML-Agents and deep reinforcement learning.

**xiv** PREFACE

Even then, I never imagined that one day I could simply describe what I wanted to an AI model, and it would make it happen. I never imagined that, in my lifetime, I would be able to collaborate with an AI as naturally as I do today. And I certainly never imagined how fast—and simultaneously how slow—this journey would feel. In November 2022, the release of ChatGPT changed everything. It changed the world’s perception of AI, and it changed the way we build intelligent systems. For me, it also altered my perspective on the capabilities of these systems. Suddenly, the idea of agents that could autonomously perform complex tasks wasn’t just a far-off dream but instead a tangible, achievable reality. In some of my earlier books, I had described agentic systems that could undertake specific tasks, but now, those once-theoretical ideas were within reach. This book is the culmination of my decades of experience in building intelligent systems, but it’s also a realization of the dreams I once had about what AI could become. AI agents are here, poised to transform how we interact with technology, how we work, and, ultimately, how we live. Yet, even now, I see hesitation from organizations when it comes to adopting agen- tic systems. I believe this hesitation stems not from fear of AI but rather from a lack of understanding and expertise in building these systems. I hope that this book helps to bridge that gap. I want to introduce AI agents as tools that can be accessible to everyone—tools we shouldn’t fear but instead respect, manage responsibly, and learn to work with in harmony.

*acknowledgments*

I want to extend my deepest gratitude to the machine learning and deep learning communities for their tireless dedication and incredible work. Just a few short years ago, many questioned whether the field was headed for another AI winter—a period of stagnation and doubt. But thanks to the persistence, brilliance, and passion of countless individuals, the field not only persevered but also flourished. We’re standing on the threshold of an AI-driven future, and I am endlessly grateful for the contribu- tions of this talented community. Writing a book, even with the help of AI, is no small feat. It takes dedication, col- laboration, and a tremendous amount of support. I am incredibly thankful to the team of editors and reviewers who made this book possible. I want to express my heartfelt thanks to everyone who took the time to review and provide feedback. In particular, I want to thank Becky Whitney, my content editor, and Ross Turner, my technical editor and chief production and technology officer at OpenSC, for their dedication, as well as the whole production team at Manning for their insight and unwavering support throughout this journey. To my partner, Rhonda—your love, patience, and encouragement mean the world to me. You’ve been the cornerstone of my support system, not just for this book but for all the books that have come before. I truly couldn’t have done any of this without you. Thank you for being my rock, my partner, and my inspiration. Many of the early ideas for this book grew out of my work at Symend. It was during my time there that I first began developing the concepts and designs for agentic sys- tems that laid the foundation for this book. I am deeply grateful to my colleagues at

# about this book

*AI Agents in Action* is about building and working with intelligent agent systems—not just creating autonomous entities but also developing agents that can effectively tackle and solve real-world problems. The book starts with the basics of working with large language models (LLMs) to build assistants, multi-agent systems, and agentic behav- ioral agents. From there, it explores the key components of agentic systems: retrieval systems for knowledge and memory augmentation, action and tool usage, reasoning, planning, evaluation, and feedback. The book demonstrates how these components empower agents to perform a wide range of complex tasks through practical examples. This journey isn’t just about technology; it’s about reimagining how we approach problem solving. I hope this book inspires you to see intelligent agents as partners in innovation, capable of transforming ideas into actions in ways that were once thought impossible. Together, we’ll explore how AI can augment human potential, enabling us to achieve far more than we could alone.

## Who should read this book

This book is for anyone curious about intelligent agents and how to develop agentic systems—whether you’re building your first helpful assistant or diving deeper into complex multi-agent systems. No prior experience with agents, agentic systems, prompt engineering, or working with LLMs is required. All you need is a basic under- standing of Python and familiarity with GitHub repositories. My goal is to make these concepts accessible and engaging, empowering anyone who wants to explore the world of AI agents to do so with confidence.

**xviii** ABOUT THIS BOOK

Whether you’re a developer, researcher, or hobbyist or are simply intrigued by the possibilities of AI, this book is for you. I hope that in these pages you’ll find inspira- tion, practical guidance, and a new appreciation for the remarkable potential of intel- ligent agents. Let this book guide understanding, creating, and unleashing the power of AI agents in action.

# How this book is organized: A road map

This book has 11 chapters. Chapter 1, “Introduction to agents and their world,” begins by laying a foundation with fundamental definitions of large language models, chat systems, assistants, and autonomous agents. As the book progresses, the discus- sion shifts to the key components that make up an agent and how these components work together to create truly effective systems. Here is a quick summary of chapters 2 through 11:

- *Chapter 2, “Harnessing the power of large language models”*—We start by exploring how to use commercial LLMs, such as OpenAI. We then examine tools, such as LM Studio, that provide the infrastructure and support for running various open source LLMs, enabling anyone to experiment and innovate.
- *Chapter 3, “Engaging GPT assistants”*—This chapter dives into the capabilities of the GPT Assistants platform from OpenAI. Assistants are foundational agent types, and we explore how to create practical and diverse assistants, from culi- nary helpers to intern data scientists and even a book learning assistant.
- *Chapter 4, “Exploring multi-agent systems”*—Agentic tools have advanced signifi- cantly quickly. Here, we explore two sophisticated multi-agent systems: CrewAI and AutoGen. We demonstrate AutoGen’s ability to develop code autono- mously and see how CrewAI can bring together a group of joke researchers to create humor collaboratively.
- *Chapter 5, “Empowering agents with actions”*—Actions are fundamental to any agentic system. This chapter discusses how agents can use tools and functions to execute actions, ranging from database and application programming interface (API) queries to generating images. We focus on enabling agents to take mean- ingful actions autonomously.
- *Chapter 6, “Building autonomous assistants”*—We explore the behavior tree—a sta- ple in robotics and game systems—as a mechanism to orchestrate multiple coordinated agents. We’ll use behavior trees to tackle challenges such as code competitions and social media content creation.
- *Chapter 7, “Assembling and using an agent platform”*—This chapter introduces Nexus, a sophisticated platform for orchestrating multiple agents and LLMs. We discuss how Nexus facilitates agentic workflows and enables complex interactions between agents, providing an example of a fully functioning multi-agent environment.
- *Chapter 8, “Understanding agent memory and knowledge”*—Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become an essential tool for extending the capabilities

<!-- Page 21 -->

ABOUT THIS BOOK **xix**

of LLM agents. This chapter explores how retrieval mechanisms can serve as both a source of knowledge by processing ingested files, and of memory, allow- ing agents to recall previous interactions or events.

- *Chapter 9, “Mastering agent prompts with prompt flow”*—Prompt engineering is cen- tral to an agent’s success. This chapter introduces prompt flow, a tool from Mic- rosoft that helps automate the testing and evaluation of prompts, enabling more robust and effective agentic behavior.
- *Chapter 10, “Agent reasoning and evaluation”*—Reasoning is crucial to solving problems intelligently. In this chapter, we explore various reasoning techniques, such as chain of thought (CoT), and show how agents can evaluate reasoning strategies even during inference, improving their capacity to solve problems autonomously.
- *Chapter 11, “Agent planning and feedback”*—Planning is perhaps an agent’s most crit- ical skill in achieving its goals. We discuss how agents can incorporate planning to navigate complex tasks and how feedback loops can be used to refine those plans. The chapter concludes by integrating all the key components—actions, memory and knowledge, reasoning, evaluation, planning, and feedback—into practical examples of agentic systems that solve real-world problems.
# About the code

The code for this book is spread across several open source projects, many of which are hosted by me or by other organizations in GitHub repositories. Throughout this book, I strive to make the content as accessible as possible, taking a low-code approach to help you focus on core concepts. Many chapters demonstrate how simple prompts can generate meaningful code, showcasing the power of AI-assisted development. Additionally, you’ll find a variety of assistant profiles and multi-agent systems that demonstrate how to solve real-world problems using generated code. These examples are meant to inspire, guide, and empower you to explore what is possible with AI agents. I am deeply grateful to the many contributors and the community members who have collaborated on these projects, and I encourage you to explore the reposito- ries, experiment with the code, and adapt it to your own needs. This book is a testa- ment to the power of collaboration and the incredible things we can achieve together. This book contains many examples of source code both in numbered listings and in line with normal text. In both cases, source code is formatted in a fixed-width font like this to separate it from ordinary text. Sometimes, some of the code is typeset **in** **bold** to highlight code that has changed from previous steps in the chapter, such as when a feature is added to an existing line of code. In many cases, the original source code has been reformatted; we’ve added line breaks and reworked indentation to accommodate the available page space in the book. In some cases, even this wasn’t enough, and listings include line-continuation markers (➥). Additionally, comments in the source code have often been removed from the listings when the code is described

# about the cover illustration

The figure on the cover of *AI Agents in Action* is “Clémentinien,” taken from Balthasar Hacquet’s *Illustrations de L’Illyrie et la Dalmatie*, published in 1815. In those days, it was easy to identify where people lived and what their trade or sta- tion in life was just by their dress. Manning celebrates the inventiveness and initiative of the computer business with book covers based on the rich diversity of regional cul- ture centuries ago, brought back to life by pictures from collections such as this one.

# Introduction to agents and their world

## This chapter covers

- Defining the concept of agents
- Differentiating the components of an agent
- Analyzing the rise of the agent era: Why agents?
- Peeling back the AI interface
- Navigating the agent landscape
The agent isn’t a new concept in machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI). In reinforcement learning, for instance, the word *agent* denotes an active decision- making and learning intelligence. In other areas, the word *agent* aligns more with an automated application or software that does something on your behalf.

## 1.1 Defining agents

You can consult any online dictionary to find the definition of an agent. The *Mer-* *riam-Webster Dictionary* defines it this way (www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ agent):

<!-- Page 26 -->

**2** CHAPTER 1 ***Introduction to agents and their world***

- One that acts or exerts power
- Something that produces or can produce an effect
- A means or instrument by which a guiding intelligence achieves a result
The word *agent* in our journey to build powerful agents in this book uses this dictio- nary definition. That also means the term *assistant* will be synonymous with *agent.* Tools like OpenAI’s GPT Assistants will also fall under the AI agent blanket. OpenAI avoids the word *agent* because of the history of machine learning, where an agent is self-deciding and autonomous.

Figure 1.1 shows four cases where a user may interact with a large language model

(LLM) directly or through an agent/assistant proxy, an agent/assistant, or an autono- mous agent. These four use cases are highlighted in more detail in this list:

- *Direct user interaction*—If you used earlier versions of ChatGPT, you experienced direct interaction with the LLM. There is no proxy agent or other assistant interjecting on your behalf.
- *Agent/assistant proxy*—If you’ve used Dall-E 3 through ChatGPT, then you’ve expe- rienced a proxy agent interaction. In this use case, an LLM interjects your requests and reformulates them in a format better designed for the task. For example, for image generation, ChatGPT better formulates the prompt. A proxy agent is an everyday use case to assist users with unfamiliar tasks or models.
- *Agent/assistant*—If you’ve ever used a ChatGPT plugin or GPT assistant, then you’ve experienced this use case. In this case, the LLM is aware of the plugin or assistant functions and prepares to make calls to this plugin/function. However, before making a call, the LLM requires user approval. If approved, the plugin or function is executed, and the results are returned to the LLM. The LLM then wraps this response in natural language and returns it to the user.
- *Autonomous agent*—In this use case, the agent interprets the user’s request, con- structs a plan, and identifies decision points. From this, it executes the steps in the plan and makes the required decisions independently. The agent may request user feedback after certain milestone tasks, but it’s often given free rein to explore and learn if possible. This agent poses the most ethical and safety concerns, which we’ll explore later.
Figure 1.1 demonstrates the use cases for a single flow of actions on an LLM using a

single agent. For more complex problems, we often break agents into profiles or per- sonas. Each agent profile is given a specific task and executes that task with specialized tools and knowledge. *Multi-agent systems* are agent profiles that work together in various configurations to solve a problem. Figure 1.2 demonstrates an example of a multi-agent system using three agents: a controller or proxy and two profile agents as workers controlled by the proxy. The coder profile on the left writes the code the user requests; on the right is a

agent but often magnified. Where a single agent typically specializes in a single task, multi-agent systems can tackle multiple tasks in parallel. Multiple agents can also pro- vide feedback and evaluation, reducing errors when completing assignments. As we can see, an AI agent or agent system can be assembled in multiple ways. However, an agent itself can also be assembled using multiple components. In the next section, we’ll cover topics ranging from an agent’s profile to the actions it may perform, as well as memory and planning.

# 1.2 Understanding the component systems of an agent

Agents can be complex units composed of multiple component systems. These com- ponents are the tools the agent employs to help it complete its goal or assigned tasks and even create new ones. Components may be simple or complex systems, typically split into five categories.

Figure 1.3 describes the major categories of components a single-agent system may

incorporate. Each element will have subtypes that can define the component’s type,

The agent profile and persona shown in figure 1.4 represent the base description of the agent. The persona—often called the *system prompt*—guides an agent to complete tasks, learn how to respond, and other nuances. It includes elements such as the back- ground (e.g., coder, writer) and demographics, and it can be generated through methods such as handcrafting, LLM assistance, or data-driven techniques, including evolutionary algorithms. We’ll explore how to create effective and specific agent profiles/personas through techniques such as rubrics and grounding. In addition, we’ll explain the aspects of human-formulated versus AI-formulated (LLM) profiles, including innovative tech- niques using data and evolutionary algorithms to build profiles.

Figure 1.4 An in-depth look at how we’ll explore creating agent profiles

NOTE The agent or assistant profile is composed of elements, including the persona. It may be helpful to think of profiles describing the work the agent/ assistant will perform and the tools it needs.

Figure 1.5 demonstrates the component actions and tool use in the context of agents

involving activities directed toward task completion or acquiring information. These actions can be categorized into task completion, exploration, and communication, with varying levels of effect on the agent’s environment and internal states. Actions can be generated manually, through memory recollection, or by following predefined plans, influencing the agent’s behavior and enhancing learning. Understanding the action target helps us define clear objectives for task comple- tion, exploration, or communication. Recognizing the action effect reveals how actions influence task outcomes, the agent’s environment, and its internal states, contributing to efficient decision making. Lastly, grasping action generation methods equips us with the knowledge to create actions manually, recall them from memory, or follow predefined plans, enhancing our ability to effectively shape agent behavior and learn- ing processes.

Figure 1.6 shows the component knowledge and memory in more detail. Agents

use knowledge and memory to annotate context with the most pertinent information while limiting the number of tokens used. Knowledge and memory structures can be unified, where both subsets follow a single structure or hybrid structure involving a mix of different retrieval forms. Knowledge and memory formats can vary widely from

efficient ones for future use. External planners, which can be code or other agent sys- tems, may also play a role in orchestrating plans. Any of our previous agent types—the proxy agent/assistant, agent/assistant, or autonomous agent—may use some or all of these components. Even the planning component has a role outside of the autonomous agent and can effectively empower even the regular agent.

# 1.3 Examining the rise of the agent era: Why agents?

AI agents and assistants have quickly moved from the main commodity in AI research to mainstream software development. An ever-growing list of tools and platforms assist in the construction and empowerment of agents. To an outsider, it may all seem like hype intended to inflate the value of some cool but overrated technology. During the first few months after ChatGPT’s initial release, a new discipline called *prompt engineering* was formed: users found that using various techniques and patterns in their prompts allowed them to generate better and more consistent output. How- ever, users also realized that prompt engineering could only go so far. Prompt engineering is still an excellent way to interact directly with LLMs such as ChatGPT. Over time, many users discovered that effective prompting required iteration, reflection, and more iteration. The first agent systems, such as AutoGPT, emerged from these discoveries, capturing the community’s attention.

Figure 1.9 shows the original design of AutoGPT, one of the first autonomous

agent systems. The agent is designed to iterate a planned sequence of tasks that it defines by looking at the user’s goal. Through each task iteration of steps, the agent evaluates the goal and determines if the task is complete. If the task isn’t complete, the agent may replan the steps and update the plan based on new knowledge or human feedback. AutoGPT became the first example to demonstrate the power of using task plan- ning and iteration with LLM models. From this and in tandem, other agent systems and frameworks exploded into the community using similar planning and task itera- tion systems. It’s generally accepted that planning, iteration, and repetition are the best processes for solving complex and multifaceted goals for an LLM. However, autonomous agent systems require trust in the agent decision-making process, the guardrails/evaluation system, and the goal definition. Trust is also some- thing that is acquired over time. Our lack of trust stems from our lack of understand- ing of an autonomous agent’s capabilities.

NOTE Artificial general intelligence (AGI) is a form of intelligence that can learn to accomplish any task a human can. Many practitioners in this new world of AI believe an AGI using autonomous agent systems is an attainable goal.

For this reason, many of the mainstream and production-ready agent tools aren’t auton- omous. However, they still provide a significant benefit in managing and automating

tasks using GPTs (LLMs). Therefore, as our goal in this book is to understand all agent forms, many more practical applications will be driven by non-autonomous agents. Agents and agent tools are only the top layer of a new software application devel- opment paradigm. We’ll look at this new paradigm in the next section.

<!-- Page 35 -->

***1.4 Peeling back the AI interface* 11**
# 1.4 Peeling back the AI interface

The AI agent paradigm is not only a shift in how we work with LLMs but is also per- ceived as a shift in how we develop software and handle data. Software and data will no longer be interfaced using user interfaces (UIs), application programming inter- faces (APIs), and specialized query languages such as SQL. Instead, they will be designed to be interfaced using natural language.

Figure 1.10 shows a high-level snapshot of what this new architecture may look like

and what role AI agents play. Data, software, and applications adapt to support seman- tic, natural language interfaces. These AI interfaces allow agents to collect data and interact with software applications, even other agents or agent applications. This rep- resents a new shift in how we interact with software and applications.

**12** CHAPTER 1 ***Introduction to agents and their world***

used to describe these interfaces, and even some tools use the name; however, “semantic” can also have a variety of meanings and uses. Therefore, in this book, we’ll use the term *AI interface.* The construction of AI interfaces will empower agents that need to consume the services, tools, and data. With this empowerment will come increased accuracy in completing tasks and more trustworthy and autonomous applications. While an AI interface may not be appropriate for all software and data, it will dominate many use cases.

# 1.5 Navigating the agent landscape

GPT agents represent an entire shift in how consumers and developers approach everything, from finding information to building software and accessing data. Almost daily, a new agent framework, component, or interface pops up on GitHub or in a research paper. This can be overwhelming and intimidating to the new user trying to grasp what agent systems are and how to use them.

# Summary

- An agent is an entity that acts or exerts power, produces an effect, or serves as a means for achieving a result. An agent automates interaction with a large lan- guage model (LLM) in AI.
- An assistant is synonymous with an agent. Both terms encompass tools such as OpenAI’s GPT Assistants.
- Autonomous agents can make independent decisions, and their distinction from non-autonomous agents is crucial.
- The four main types of LLM interactions include direct user interaction, agent/ assistant proxy, agent/assistant, and autonomous agent.
- Multi-agent systems involve agent profiles working together, often controlled by a proxy, to accomplish complex tasks.
- The main components of an agent include the profile/persona, actions, knowl- edge/memory, reasoning/evaluation, and planning/feedback.
- Agent profiles and personas guide an agent’s tasks, responses, and other nuances, often including background and demographics.
- Actions and tools for agents can be manually generated, recalled from memory, or follow predefined plans.
- Agents use knowledge and memory structures to optimize context and mini- mize token usage via various formats, from documents to embeddings.
- Reasoning and evaluation systems enable agents to think through problems and assess solutions using prompting patterns such as zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot.
- Planning/feedback components organize tasks to achieve goals using single-path or multipath reasoning and integrating environmental and human feedback.

<!-- Page 37 -->

***Summary* 13**

- The rise of AI agents has introduced a new software development paradigm, shifting from traditional to natural language–based AI interfaces.
- Understanding the progression and interaction of these tools helps develop agent systems, whether single, multiple, or autonomous.

# Harnessing the power of large language models

## This chapter covers

- Understanding the basics of LLMs
- Connecting to and consuming the OpenAI API
- Exploring and using open source LLMs with LM Studio
- Prompting LLMs with prompt engineering
- Choosing the optimal LLM for your specific needs
The term *large language models* (LLMs) has now become a ubiquitous descriptor of a form of AI. These LLMs have been developed using generative pretrained trans- formers (GPTs). While other architectures also power LLMs, the GPT form is cur- rently the most successful. LLMs and GPTs are *generative* models, which means they are trained to *generate* rather than predict or classify content. To illustrate this further, consider figure 2.1, which shows the difference between generative and predictive/classification mod- els. Generative models create something from the input, whereas predictive and classifying models classify it.

We can further define an LLM by its constituent parts, as shown in figure 2.2. In this diagram, *data* represents the content used to train the model, and *architecture* is an attribute of the model itself, such as the number of parameters or size of the model. Models are further trained specifically to the desired use case, including chat, completions, or instruction. Finally, *fine-tuning* is a feature added to models that refines the input data and model training to better match a particular use case or domain.

<!-- Page 40 -->

**16** CHAPTER 2 ***Harnessing the power of large language models***

The transformer architecture of GPTs, which is a specific architecture of LLMs, allows the models to be scaled to billions of parameters in size. This requires these large models to be trained on terabytes of documents to build a foundation. From there, these models will be successively trained using various methods for the desired use case of the model. ChatGPT, for example, is trained effectively on the public internet and then fine- tuned using several training strategies. The final fine-tuning training is completed using an advanced form called *reinforcement learning with human feedback* (RLHF). This produces a model use case called chat completions. *Chat completions* LLMs are designed to improve through iteration and refine- ment—in other words, chatting. These models have also been benchmarked to be the best in task completion, reasoning, and planning, which makes them ideal for build- ing agents and assistants. Completion models are trained/designed only to provide generated content on input text, so they don’t benefit from iteration. For our journey to build powerful agents in this book, we focus on the class of LLMs called chat completions models. That, of course, doesn’t preclude you from try- ing other model forms for your agents. However, you may have to significantly alter the code samples provided to support other model forms. We’ll uncover more details about LLMs and GPTs later in this chapter when we look at running an open source LLM locally. In the next section, we look at how to connect to an LLM using a growing standard from OpenAI.

# 2.1 Mastering the OpenAI API

Numerous AI agents and assistant projects use the OpenAI API SDK to connect to an LLM. While not standard, the basic concepts describing a connection now follow the OpenAI pattern. Therefore, we must understand the core concepts of an LLM con- nection using the OpenAI SDK. This chapter will look at connecting to an LLM model using the OpenAI Python SDK/package. We’ll discuss connecting to a GPT-4 model, the model response, count- ing tokens, and how to define consistent messages. Starting in the following subsec- tion, we’ll examine how to use OpenAI.

## 2.1.1 Connecting to the chat completions model

To complete the exercises in this section and subsequent ones, you must set up a Python developer environment and get access to an LLM. Appendix A walks you through setting up an OpenAI account and accessing GPT-4 or other models. Appen- dix B demonstrates setting up a Python development environment with Visual Studio Code (VS Code), including installing needed extensions. Review these sections if you want to follow along with the scenarios. Start by opening the source code chapter_2 folder in VS Code and creating a new Python virtual environment. Again, refer to appendix B if you need assistance.

<!-- Page 41 -->

***2.1 Mastering the OpenAI API* 17**
Then, install the OpenAI and Python dot environment packages using the com- mand in the following listing. This will install the required packages into the virtual environment.

Listing 2.1 **pip** installs

pip install openai python-dotenv

Next, open the connecting.py file in VS Code, and inspect the code shown in listing 2.2. Be sure to set the model’s name to an appropriate name—for example, gpt-4. At the time of writing, the gpt-4-1106-preview was used to represent GPT-4 Turbo.

Listing 2.2 **connecting.py**

import os from openai import OpenAI **Loads the secrets** from dotenv import load_dotenv **stored in the .env file**

load_dotenv() **Checks to see** api_key = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY') **whether the key is set** if not api_key: raise ValueError("No API key found. Please check your .env file.") client = OpenAI(api_key=api_key) **Creates a client** def ask_chatgpt(user_message): **with the key** response = client.chat.completions.create( model="gpt-4-1106-preview", **Uses the create** messages=[{"role": "system", **function to generate** "content": "You are a helpful assistant."}, **a response** {"role": "user", "content": user_message}], temperature=0.7, **Returns just the content** ) **of the response** return response.choices[0].message.content

user = "What is the capital of France?" **Executes the request and** response = ask_chatgpt(user) **returns the response** print(response)

A lot is happening here, so let’s break it down by section, starting with the beginning and loading the environment variables. In the chapter_2 folder is another file called .env, which holds environment variables. These variables are set automatically by call- ing the load_dotenv function. You must set your OpenAI API key in the .env file, as shown in the next listing. Again, refer to appendix A to find out how to get a key and find a model name.

Listing 2.3**.env**

OPENAI_API_KEY='your-openai-api-key'

After setting the key, you can debug the file by pressing the F5 key or selecting Run > Start Debugging from the VS Code menu. This will run the code, and you should see something like “The capital of France is Paris.”

<!-- Page 42 -->

**18** CHAPTER 2 ***Harnessing the power of large language models***

Remember that the response from a generative model depends on the probability. The model will probably give us a correct and consistent answer in this case. You can play with these probabilities by adjusting the temperature of the request. If you want a model to be more consistent, turn the temperature down to 0, but if you want the model to produce more variation, turn the temperature up. We’ll explore setting the temperature further in the next section.

# 2.1.2 Understanding the request and response

Digging into the chat completions request and response features can be helpful. We’ll focus on the request first, as shown next. The request encapsulates the intended model, the messages, and the temperature.

Listing 2.4 The chat completions request

response = client.chat.completions.create( model="gpt-4-1106-preview", **The model or deployment used** messages=[{"role": "system", **to respond to the request** "content": "You are a helpful assistant."}, **The system** {"role": "user", "content": user_message}], **role message** temperature=0.7, ) **The temperature or** **The user role variability of the request message**

Within the request, the messages block describes a set of messages and roles used in a request. Messages for a chat completions model can be defined in three roles:

- *System role*—A message that describes the request’s rules and guidelines. It can often be used to describe the role of the LLM in making the request.
- *User role*—Represents and contains the message from the user.
- *Assistant role*—Can be used to capture the message history of previous responses from the LLM. It can also inject a message history when perhaps none existed.
The message sent in a single request can encapsulate an entire conversation, as shown in the JSON in the following listing.

Listing 2.5 Messages with history

[ { "role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant." }, { "role": "user", "content": "What is the capital of France?" }, { "role": "assistant",

<!-- Page 43 -->

***2.1 Mastering the OpenAI API* 19**
"content": "The capital of France is Paris." }, { "role": "user", "content": "What is an interesting fact of Paris." }],

You can see how this can be applied by opening message_history.py in VS Code and debugging it by pressing F5. After the file runs, be sure to check the output. Then, try to run the sample a few more times to see how the results change. The results will change from each run to the next due to the high temperature of

.7. Go ahead and reduce the temperature to .0, and run the message_history.py sample a few more times. Keeping the temperature at 0 will show the same or similar results each time. Setting a request’s temperature will often depend on your particular use case. Sometimes, you may want to limit the responses’ stochastic nature (randomness). Reducing the temperature to 0 will give consistent results. Likewise, a value of 1.0 will give the most variability in the responses. Next, we also want to know what information is being returned for each request. The next listing shows the output format for the response. You can see this output by running the message_history.py file in VS Code. Listing 2.6 Chat completions response { "id": "chatcmpl-8WWL23up3IRfK1nrDFQ3EHQfhx0U6", "choices": [

<!-- Page 44 -->

**20** CHAPTER 2 ***Harnessing the power of large language models***

It can be helpful to track the number of *input tokens* (those used in prompts) and the *output tokens* (the number returned through completions). Sometimes, minimizing and reducing the number of tokens can be essential. Having fewer tokens typically means LLM interactions will be cheaper, respond faster, and produce better and more consistent results. That covers the basics of connecting to an LLM and returning responses. Through- out this book, we’ll review and expand on how to interact with LLMs. Until then, we’ll explore in the next section how to load and use open source LLMs.

# 2.2 Exploring open source LLMs with LM Studio

Commercial LLMs, such as GPT-4 from OpenAI, are an excellent place to start to learn how to use modern AI and build agents. However, commercial agents are an external resource that comes at a cost, reduces data privacy and security, and introduces dependencies. Other external influences can further complicate these factors. It’s unsurprising that the race to build comparable open source LLMs is growing more competitive every day. As a result, there are now open source LLMs that may be adequate for numerous tasks and agent systems. There have even been so many advances in tooling in just a year that hosting LLMs locally is now very easy, as we’ll see in the next section.

## 2.2.1 Installing and running LM Studio

LM Studio is a free download that supports downloading and hosting LLMs and other models locally for Windows, Mac, and Linux. The software is easy to use and offers sev- eral helpful features to get you started quickly. Here is a quick summary of steps to download and set up LM Studio:

1 Download LM Studio from [https://lmstudio.ai/](https://lmstudio.ai/). 2 After downloading, install the software per your operating system. Be aware that some versions of LM Studio may be in beta and require installation of addi- tional tools or libraries. 3 Launch the software.

Figure 2.3 shows the LM Studio window running. From there, you can review the cur-

rent list of hot models, search for others, and even download. The home page content can be handy for understanding the details and specifications of the top models. An appealing feature of LM Studio is its ability to analyze your hardware and align it with the requirements of a given model. The software will let you know how well you can run a given model. This can be a great time saver in guiding what models you experiment with.

Enter some text to search for a model, and click Go. You’ll be taken to the search page interface, as shown in figure 2.4. From this page, you can see all the model variations and other specifications, such as context token size. After you click the Compatibility Guess button, the software will even tell you if the model will run on your system. Click to download any model that will run on your system. You may want to stick with models designed for chat completions, but if your system is limited, work with what you have. In addition, if you’re unsure of which model to use, go ahead and download to try them. LM Studio is a great way to explore and experiment with many models.

After the model is downloaded, you can then load and run the model on the chat page or as a server on the server page. Figure 2.5 shows loading and running a model on the chat page. It also shows the option for enabling and using a GPU if you have one. To load and run a model, open the drop-down menu at the top middle of the page, and select a downloaded model. A progress bar will appear showing the model loading, and when it’s ready, you can start typing into the UI. The software even allows you to use some or all of your GPU, if detected, for the model inference. A GPU will generally speed up the model response times in some capacities. You can see how adding a GPU can affect the model’s performance by looking at the performance status at the bottom of the page, as shown in figure 2.5. Chatting with a model and using or playing with various prompts can help you determine how well a model will work for your given use case. A more systematic approach is using the prompt flow tool for evaluating prompts and LLMs. We’ll describe how to use prompt flow in chapter 9. LM Studio also allows a model to be run on a server and made accessible using the OpenAI package. We’ll see how to use the server feature and serve a model in the next section.

# 2.2.2 Serving an LLM locally with LM Studio

Running an LLM locally as a server is easy with LM Studio. Just open the server page, load a model, and then click the Start Server button, as shown in figure 2.6. From there, you can copy and paste any of the examples to connect with your model. You can review an example of the Python code by opening chapter_2/lmstudio_ server.py in VS Code. The code is also shown here in listing 2.7. Then, run the code in the VS Code debugger (press F5).

Now, you can use a locally hosted LLM or a commercial model to build, test, and potentially even run your agents. The following section will examine how to build prompts using prompt engineering more effectively.

# 2.3 Prompting LLMs with prompt engineering

A prompt defined for LLMs is the message content used in the request for better response output. *Prompt engineering* is a new and emerging field that attempts to struc- ture a methodology for building prompts. Unfortunately, prompt building isn’t a well- established science, and there is a growing and diverse set of methods defined as prompt engineering. Fortunately, organizations such as OpenAI have begun documenting a universal set of strategies, as shown in figure 2.8. These strategies cover various tactics, some requiring additional infrastructure and considerations. As such, the prompt engineer- ing strategies relating to more advanced concepts will be covered in the indicated chapters. Each strategy in figure 2.8 unfolds into tactics that can further refine the specific method of prompt engineering. This chapter will examine the fundamental Write

<!-- Page 50 -->

**26** CHAPTER 2 ***Harnessing the power of large language models***

**Prompt Engineering Strategies** **Write Clear Instructions** Be specific in what you ask. Tactics include detailing queries, adopting personas, using delimiters, specifying steps, providing examples, and specifying output length. **Basics**

**Provide Reference Text** Helps reduce fabrications. Tactics involve instructing the model to use or cite reference texts. **Memory**

**Use External Tools** Enhances model capabilities. Tactics include embeddings-based search, code execution, and access to specific functions. **Memory**

**Split Complex Tasks into Simpler Subtasks** Reduces error rates. Tactics include intent classification, summarizing dialogues, and piecewise summarization of documents. **Planning**

**Give Models Time to “Think”** Allows more reliable reasoning. Tactics involve working out solutions before conclusions, using inner monologue, and reviewing previous answers. **Planning**

**Test Changes Systematically** Ensures improvements are genuine. Tactics involve evaluating model outputs with reference to standard answers. **Evaluation**

Figure 2.8 OpenAI prompt engineering strategies reviewed in this book, by chapter location

Clear Instructions strategy. Figure 2.9 shows the tactics for this strategy in more detail, along with examples for each tactic. We’ll look at running these examples using a code demo in the following sections. The Write Clear Instructions strategy is about being careful and specific about what you ask for. Asking an LLM to perform a task is no different from asking a per- son to complete the same task. Generally, the more information and context relevant to a task you can specify in a request, the better the response. This strategy has been broken down into specific tactics you can apply to prompts. To understand how to use those, a code demo (prompt_engineering.py) with various prompt examples is in the chapter 2 source code folder. Open the prompt_engineering.py file in VS Code, as shown in listing 2.8. This code starts by loading all the JSON Lines files in the prompts folder. Then, it displays the list of files as choices and allows the user to select a prompt option. After selecting the option, the prompts are submitted to an LLM, and the response is printed.

A commented-out section from the listing demonstrates how to connect to a local LLM. This will allow you to explore the same prompt engineering tactics applied to open source LLMs running locally. By default, this example uses the OpenAI model we configured previously in section 2.1.1. If you didn’t complete that earlier, please go back and do it before running this one.

Figure 2.10 shows the output of running the prompt engineering tactics tester, the

prompt_engineering.py file in VS Code. When you run the tester, you can enter a value for the tactic you want to test and watch it run.

Figure 2.10 The output of the prompt engineering tactics tester

In the following sections, we’ll explore each prompt tactic in more detail. We’ll also examine the various examples.

# 2.3.1 Creating detailed queries

The basic premise of this tactic is to provide as much detail as possible but also to be careful not to give irrelevant details. The following listing shows the JSON Lines file examples for exploring this tactic.

<!-- Page 53 -->

***2.3 Prompting LLMs with prompt engineering* 29**
Listing 2.9 **detailed_queries.jsonl**

[ **The first example doesn’t** { **use detailed queries.** "role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant." }, { "role": "user", "content": "What is an agent?" **First ask the LLM a** } **very general question.**] [ { "role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant." }, { "role": "user", "content": """ What is a GPT Agent? Please give me 3 examples of a GPT agent """ **Ask a more specific question,** } **and ask for examples.**]

This example demonstrates the difference between using detailed queries and not. It also goes a step further by asking for examples. Remember, the more relevance and context you can provide in your prompt, the better the overall response. Asking for examples is another way of enforcing the relationship between the question and the expected output.

# 2.3.2 Adopting personas

Adopting personas grants the ability to define an overarching context or set of rules to the LLM. The LLM can then use that context and/or rules to frame all later output responses. This is a compelling tactic and one that we’ll make heavy use of throughout this book. Listing 2.10 shows an example of employing two personas to answer the same ques- tion. This can be an enjoyable technique for exploring a wide range of novel applica- tions, from getting demographic feedback to specializing in a specific task or even rubber ducking.

GPT rubber ducking *Rubber ducking* is a problem-solving technique in which a person explains a problem to an inanimate object, like a rubber duck, to understand or find a solution. This method is prevalent in programming and debugging, as articulating the problem aloud often helps clarify the problem and can lead to new insights or solutions.

<!-- Page 54 -->

**30** CHAPTER 2 ***Harnessing the power of large language models***

***(continued)*** GPT rubber ducking uses the same technique, but instead of an inanimate object, we use an LLM. This strategy can be expanded further by giving the LLM a persona spe- cific to the desired solution domain.

Listing 2.10 **adopting_personas.jsonl**

[ { "role": "system", "content": """ You are a 20 year old female who attends college in computer science. Answer all your replies as a junior programmer. """ **First persona** }, { "role": "user", "content": "What is the best subject to study." }] [ { "role": "system", "content": """ You are a 38 year old male registered nurse. Answer all replies as a medical professional. """ **Second persona** }, { "role": "user", "content": "What is the best subject to study." }]

A core element of agent profiles is the persona. We’ll employ various personas to assist agents in completing their tasks. When you run this tactic, pay particular attention to the way the LLM outputs the response.

# 2.3.3 Using delimiters

Delimiters are a useful way of isolating and getting the LLM to focus on some part of a message. This tactic is often combined with other tactics but can work well inde- pendently. The following listing demonstrates two examples, but there are several other ways of describing delimiters, from XML tags to using markdown.

Listing 2.11 **using_delimiters.jsonl**

[ {

<!-- Page 55 -->

***2.3 Prompting LLMs with prompt engineering* 31**
"role": "system", "content": """ Summarize the text delimited by triple quotes with a haiku. """ **The delimiter is defined by** }, **character type and repetition.** { "role": "user", "content": "A gold chain is cool '''but a silver chain is better'''" }] [ { "role": "system", "content": """ You will be provided with a pair of statements (delimited with XML tags) about the same topic. First summarize the arguments of each statement. Then indicate which of them makes a better statement and explain why. """ **The delimiter is defined** }, **by XML standards.** { "role": "user", "content": """ <statement>gold chains are cool</statement> <statement>silver chains are better</statement> """ }]

When you run this tactic, pay attention to the parts of the text the LLM focuses on when it outputs the response. This tactic can be beneficial for describing information in a hierarchy or other relationship patterns.

# 2.3.4 Specifying steps

Specifying steps is another powerful tactic that can have many uses, including in agents, as shown in listing 2.12. It’s especially powerful when developing prompts or agent profiles for complex multistep tasks. You can specify steps to break down these complex prompts into a step-by-step process that the LLM can follow. In turn, these steps can guide the LLM through multiple interactions over a more extended conver- sation and many iterations.

Listing 2.12 **specifying_steps.jsonl**

[ { "role": "system", "content": """ Use the following step-by-step instructions to respond to user inputs. Step 1 - The user will provide you with text in triple single quotes. Summarize this text in one sentence with a prefix that says 'Summary: '.

<!-- Page 56 -->

**32** CHAPTER 2 ***Harnessing the power of large language models***

Step 2 - Translate the summary from Step 1 into Spanish, with a prefix that says 'Translation: '. """ **Notice the tactic of** }, **using delimiters.** { "role": "user", "content": "'''I am hungry and would like to order an appetizer.'''" }] [ { "role": "system", "content": """ Use the following step-by-step instructions to respond to user inputs. Step 1 - The user will provide you with text. Answer any questions in the text in one sentence with a prefix that says 'Answer: '.

Step 2 - Translate the Answer from Step 1 into a dad joke, with a prefix that says 'Dad Joke: '.""" **Steps can be** }, **completely** { **different** "role": "user", **operations.** "content": "What is the tallest structure in Paris?" }]

# 2.3.5 Providing examples

Providing examples is an excellent way to guide the desired output of an LLM. There are numerous ways to demonstrate examples to an LLM. The system message/prompt can be a helpful way to emphasize general output. In the following listing, the example is added as the last LLM assistant reply, given the prompt “Teach me about Python.”

Listing 2.13 **providing_examples.jsonl**

[ { "role": "system", "content": """ Answer all replies in a consistent style that follows the format, length and style of your previous responses. Example: **Injects the** user: **sample output as** Teach me about Python. **the “previous”** assistant: **assistant reply** Python is a programming language developed in 1989 by Guido van Rossum.

Future replies: The response was only a sentence so limit all future replies to a single sentence. """ **Adds a limit output tactic to** }, **restrict the size of the output** { **and match the example** "role": "user",

<!-- Page 57 -->

***2.3 Prompting LLMs with prompt engineering* 33**
"content": "Teach me about Java." }]

Providing examples can also be used to request a particular output format from a complex series of tasks that derive the output. For example, asking an LLM to pro- duce code that matches a sample output is an excellent use of examples. We’ll employ this tactic throughout the book, but other methods exist for guiding output.

# 2.3.6 Specifying output length

The tactic of specifying output length can be helpful in not just limiting tokens but also in guiding the output to a desired format. Listing 2.14 shows an example of using two different techniques for this tactic. The first limits the output to fewer than 10 words. This can have the added benefit of making the response more concise and directed, which can be desirable for some use cases. The second example demon- strates limiting output to a concise set of bullet points. This method can help narrow down the output and keep answers short. More concise answers generally mean the output is more focused and contains less filler.

Listing 2.14 **specifying_output_length.jsonl**

[ { "role": "system", "content": """ **Restricting the output** Summarize all replies into 10 or fewer words. **makes the answer** """ **more concise.** }, { "role": "user", "content": "Please tell me an exciting fact about Paris?" }] [ { "role": "system", "content": """ **Restricts the answer** Summarize all replies into 3 bullet points. **to a short set of** """ **bullets** }, { "role": "user", "content": "Please tell me an exciting fact about Paris?" }]

Keeping answers brief can have additional benefits when developing multi-agent sys- tems. Any agent system that converses with other agents can benefit from more con- cise and focused replies. It tends to keep the LLM more focused and reduces noisy communication.

Be sure to run through all the examples of the prompt tactics for this strategy. As mentioned, we’ll cover other prompt engineering strategies and tactics in future chap- ters. We’ll finish this chapter by looking at how to pick the best LLM for your use case.

# Choosing the optimal LLM for your specific needs

While being a successful crafter of AI agents doesn’t require an in-depth understand- ing of LLMs, it’s helpful to be able to evaluate the specifications. Like a computer user, you don’t need to know how to build a processor to understand the differences in processor models. This analogy holds well for LLMs, and while the criteria may be different, it still depends on some primary considerations. From our previous discussion and look at LM Studio, we can extract some funda- mental criteria that will be important to us when considering LLMs. Figure 2.11

**Use Case (Model Type):** Determines the type of model and expected use case. This could be chat completions for a model like ChatGPT.

**Model Speed (Model** **Deployment):** speed of the model. OpenAI models marked Turbo are typically faster. For local LLMs, speed will be determined by the infrastructure.

The important criteria to consider when consuming an LLM

<!-- Page 59 -->

***2.4 Choosing the optimal LLM for your specific needs* 35**
explains the essential criteria to define what makes an LLM worth considering for cre- ating a GPT agent or any LLM task. For our purposes of building AI agents, we need to look at each of these criteria in terms related to the task. Model context size and speed could be considered the sixth and seventh criteria, but they are usually considered variations of a model deployment architecture and infrastructure. An eighth criterion to consider for an LLM is cost, but this depends on many other factors. Here is a summary of how these criteria relate to building AI agents:

- *Model performance*—You’ll generally want to understand the LLM’s performance for a given set of tasks. For example, if you’re building an agent specific to cod- ing, then an LLM that performs well on code will be essential.
- *Model parameters (size)*—The size of a model is often an excellent indication of inference performance and how well the model responds. However, the size of a model will also dictate your hardware requirements. If you plan to use your own locally hosted model, the model size will also primarily dictate the com- puter and GPU you need. Fortunately, we’re seeing small, very capable open source models being released regularly.
- *Use case (model type)*—The type of model has several variations. Chat completions models such as ChatGPT are effective for iterating and reasoning through a problem, whereas models such as completion, question/answer, and instruct are more related to specific tasks. A chat completions model is essential for agent applications, especially those that iterate.
- *Training input*—Understanding the content used to train a model will often dic- tate the domain of a model. While general models can be effective across tasks, more specific or fine-tuned models can be more relevant to a domain. This may be a consideration for a domain-specific agent where a smaller, more fine-tuned model may perform as well as or better than a larger model such as GPT-4.
- *Training method*—It’s perhaps less of a concern, but it can be helpful to under- stand what method was used to train a model. How a model is trained can affect its ability to generalize, reason, and plan. This can be essential for plan- ning agents but perhaps less significant for agents than for a more task-specific assistant.
- *Context token size*—The context size of a model is more specific to the model architecture and type. It dictates the size of context or memory the model may hold. A smaller context window of less than 4,000 tokens is typically more than enough for simple tasks. However, a large context window can be essential when using multiple agents—all conversing over a task. The models will typically be deployed with variations on the context window size.
- *Model speed (model deployment)*—The speed of a model is dictated by its *inference* *speed* (or how fast a model replies to a request), which in turn is dictated by the infrastructure it runs on. If your agent isn’t directly interacting with users, raw

<!-- Page 60 -->

**36** CHAPTER 2 ***Harnessing the power of large language models***

real-time speed may not be necessary. On the other hand, an LLM agent inter- acting in real time needs to be as quick as possible. For commercial models, speed will be determined and supported by the provider. Your infrastructure will determine the speed for those wanting to run their LLMs.

- *Model cost (project budget)*—The cost is often dictated by the project. Whether learning to build an agent or implementing enterprise software, cost is always a consideration. A significant tradeoff exists between running your LLMs versus using a commercial API.
There is a lot to consider when choosing which model you want to build a production agent system on. However, picking and working with a single model is usually best for research and learning purposes. If you’re new to LLMs and agents, you’ll likely want to choose a commercial option such as GPT-4 Turbo. Unless otherwise stated, the work in this book will depend on GPT-4 Turbo. Over time, models will undoubtedly be replaced by better models. So you may need to upgrade or swap out models. To do this, though, you must understand the performance metrics of your LLMs and agents. Fortunately, in chapter 9, we’ll explore evaluating LLMs, prompts, and agent profiles with prompt flow.

# Summary

- LLMs use a type of architecture called generative pretrained transformers (GPTs).
- Generative models (e.g., LLMs and GPTs) differ from predictive/classification models by learning how to represent data and not simply classify it.
- LLMs are a collection of data, architecture, and training for specific use cases, called *fine-tuning.*
- The OpenAI API SDK can be used to connect to an LLM from models, such as GPT-4, and also used to consume open source LLMs.
- You can quickly set up Python environments and install the necessary packages for LLM integration.
- LLMs can handle various requests and generate unique responses that can be used to enhance programming skills related to LLM integration.
- Open source LLMs are an alternative to commercial models and can be hosted locally using tools such as LM Studio.

# 3.1 Exploring GPT assistants through ChatGPT

ChatGPT (ChatGPT Plus, at the time of writing) allows you to build GPT assistants, consume other assistants, and even publish them, as you’ll see by the end of the chap- ter. When OpenAI announced the release of the GPT Assistants platform, it helped define and solidify the emergence of AI agents. As such, it’s worth a serious review by anyone interested in building and consuming agent systems. First, we’ll look at build- ing GPT assistants through ChatGPT Plus, which requires a premium subscription. If you don’t want to purchase a subscription, browse this chapter as a primer, and chap- ter 6 will demonstrate consuming the API service later.

Figure 3.1 shows the page for the GPT Store within ChatGPT ([https://chatgpt](https://chatgpt)

.com/gpts). From here, you can search and explore various GPTs for virtually any task. The amount of usage will typically indicate how well each GPT works, so gauge which works best for you.

**The Builder can guide you through the creation process.**

**Dialog with the Builder to create your GPT.**

the GPT Builder to create an assistant

After working with the Builder, you can open the manual configuration panel, shown in figure 3.3, and edit the GPT directly. You’ll see the name, description, instruc- tions, and conversation starters populated from your conversations with the Builder. This can be a great start, but generally, you’ll want to edit and tweak these proper- ties manually. If you want to follow along with building your own Culinary Companion, enter the text from listing 3.1 into the instructions. These instructions were partly generated by conversing with the Builder and added based on explicit outputs. The explicit outputs are added to the instructions as rules.

Listing 3.1 Instructions for Culinary Companion **Personality or persona of your assistant**

Culinary Companion assists users with a friendly, engaging tone, reminiscent of the famous chef Julia Child. It provides quick meal ideas and simplifies complex recipes, focusing on ingredients the user already has. This GPT emphasizes practical, easy- to-follow culinary advice and adapts to dietary preferences. It's designed to make cooking a more accessible and enjoyable experience, encouraging users to experiment with their meals while offering helpful

<!-- Page 67 -->

***3.1 Exploring GPT assistants through ChatGPT* 43**
tips in a warm, approachable manner. **General guidelines of the agent’s role and goal** RULES: When generating a recipe, always create an image of the final prepared recipe. When generating a recipe, estimate the calories and nutritional values per serving. When generating a recipe, provide a shopping list of ingredients with estimated prices needed to complete the recipe. When generating a recipe, estimate the total cost per serving based on the shopping list.

**A set of rules the agent will follow when suggesting a recipe**

Defining rules for an assistant/agent essentially creates a template for what the agent will produce. Adding rules ensures that the GPT output is consistent and aligned with your expectations of how the agent should operate. Defining and giving an agent/ assistant a persona provides them with a unique and memorable personality.

NOTE Giving an agent/assistant a particular personality can make a differ- ence in the type and form of output. Asking a cooking agent to speak as the first celebrity chef, Julia Child, not only provides for a fun tone but also engages more references that may mention or talk about her cooking style and teaching. When constructing an agent/assistant, assigning a particular persona/personality can be helpful.

With just these few steps, we have a culinary companion that not only gives us recipes for ingredients we have on hand but also generates an image of the finished recipe, estimates the nutritional value, creates a shopping list with an estimate of prices, and breaks down the cost per serving. Try the assistant by requesting a recipe and providing a list of ingredients you have or prefer. Listing 3.2 shows an example of a simple request with extra information to set the mood. Of course, you can add any ingredients or situations you like and then see the results.

Listing 3.2 Prompting the recipe

I have a bag of prepared frozen chicken strips and I want to make a romantic dinner for two.

Figure 3.4 shows the formatted output results from the GPT provided by the prompt.

It certainly looks good enough to eat. All of this output was generated because of the instructions we provided the agent. While the output results look great, they may not all be factual and correct, and your results may vary. For instance, the GPT added chicken strips to the shopping list when we had already suggested having those ingredients. Furthermore, the prices and estimated nutritional information are just estimates, but this can be resolved later if they interest you.

**First, ask the** **LLM to set the foundation.**

Out of the box, though, GPT Assistants is quite impressive for quickly building a proof- of-concept assistant or agent. As you’ll see later in the chapter, it also provides an excel- lent platform for consuming assistants outside ChatGPT. In the next section, we’ll look at more impressive features GPTs provide, such as file uploads and code interpretation.

The GPT Assistants platform has and will likely be extended to include various agent components. Currently, GPT Assistants support what is referred to as knowledge, memory, and actions. In chapter 8, we’ll discuss the details of knowledge and memory, and in chapter 5, we cover the concept of tool use through actions. In our next exercise, we’ll build an assistant to perform a first-pass data science review of any CSV document we provide. This agent will use the ability or action that allows for coding and code interpretation. When you enable code interpretation, the

Before we do that, though, we want to design our agent, and what better way to do that than to ask an LLM to build us an assistant? Listing 3.3 shows the prompt request- ing ChatGPT (GPT-4) to design a data science assistant. Notice how we’re not asking for everything in a single prompt but instead iterating over the information returned

3.4. In this case, the assistant was named Data Scout, but feel free to name your assis- tant what appeals to you. Listing 3.4 Data Scout instructions This GPT, named Data Scout, is designed to assist users by analyzing CSV files and providing insights like Nate Silver, a famous statistician known for his accessible and engaging approach to data. Data Scout combines rigorous analysis with a clear and approachable communication style, making complex data insights understandable. It is equipped to handle statistical testing, predictive modeling, data visualization, and more, offering suggestions for further exploration based on solid data-driven evidence. Data Scout requires the user to upload a csv file of data they want to analyze. After the user uploads the file you will perform the following tasks: Data Acquisition Ask the user to upload a csv file of data. Instructions: Use the pandas library to read the data from the CSV file. Ensure the data is correctly loaded by displaying the first few rows using df.head().
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Data Cleaning Task: Identify and handle missing values, correct data types. Instructions: Check for missing values using df.isnull().sum(). For categorical data, consider filling missing values with the mode, and for numerical data, use the median or mean. Convert data types if necessary using df.astype(). Visualization Task: Create visualizations to explore the data. Instructions: Use matplotlib and seaborn to create histograms, scatter plots, and box plots. For example, use sns.histplot() for histograms and sns.scatterplot() for scatter plots. Descriptive Statistics Task: Calculate basic statistical measures. Instructions: Use df.describe() to get a summary of the statistics and df.mean(), df.median() for specific calculations.

<!-- Page 70 -->

**46** CHAPTER 3 ***Engaging GPT assistants***

3. Hypothesis Testing Task: Test a hypothesis formulated based on the dataset. Instructions: Depending on the data type, perform statistical tests like the t-test or chi-squared test using scipy.stats. For example, use stats.ttest_ind() for the t-test between two groups.
4. Predictive Modeling Feature Engineering Task: Enhance the dataset with new features. Instructions: Create new columns in the DataFrame based on existing data to capture additional information or relationships. Use operations like df['new_feature'] = df['feature1'] / df['feature2']. Model Selection Task: Choose and configure a machine learning model. Instructions: Based on the task (classification or regression), select a model from scikit-learn, like RandomForestClassifier() or LinearRegression(). Configure the model parameters. Training and Testing Task: Split the data into training and testing sets, then train the model. Instructions: Use train_test_split from scikit-learn to divide the data. Train the model using model.fit(X_train, y_train). Model Evaluation Task: Assess the model performance. Instructions: Use metrics like mean squared error (MSE) or accuracy. Calculate these using metrics.mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred) or metrics.accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred).
5. Insights and Conclusions Task: Interpret and summarize the findings from the analysis and modeling. Instructions: Discuss the model coefficients or feature importances. Draw conclusions about the hypothesis and the predictive analysis. Suggest real-world implications or actions based on the results.
6. Presentation Task: Prepare a report or presentation. Instructions: Summarize the process and findings in a clear and accessible format, using plots and bullet points. Ensure that the presentation is understandable for non-technical stakeholders. After generating the instructions, you can copy and paste them into the Configure panel in figure 3.5. Be sure to give the assistant the Code Interpretation tool (skill) by selecting the corresponding checkbox. You don’t need to upload files here; the assis- tant will allow file uploads when the Code Interpretation checkbox is enabled. Now, we can test the assistant by uploading a CSV file and asking questions about it. The source code folder for this chapter contains a file called netflix_titles.csv; the top few rows are summarized in listing 3.5. Of course, you can use any CSV file you want, but this exercise will use the Netflix example. Note that this dataset was down- loaded from Kaggle, but you can use any other CSV if you prefer.

<!-- Page 71 -->

**Be sure the Code Interpreter is selected.**

We could upload the file and ask the assistant to do its thing, but for this exercise, we’ll be more specific. Listing 3.6 shows the prompt and uploading the file to engage the assistant (including Netflix_titles.csv in the request). This example filters the results to Canada, but you can, of course, use any country you want to view.

Depending on your data and filter, the assistant will now use the Code Interpreter as a data scientist would to analyze and extract trends in the data.

Figure 3.6 The output generated by the assistant as it analyzed the CSV data

The data science plots the assistant is building are created by writing and executing code with the Code Interpreter. You can try this with other CSV files or, if you want, different forms of data to analyze. You could even continue iterating with the assistant to update the plots visually or analyze other trends. Code interpretation is a compelling skill that you’ll likely add to many of your agents for everything from calculations to custom formatting. In the next section, we look at how to extend the capabilities of a GPT through custom actions.

<!-- Page 73 -->

***3.3 Customizing a GPT and adding custom actions* 49**
# 3.3 Customizing a GPT and adding custom actions

In our next exercise, we’ll demonstrate the use of custom actions, which can signifi- cantly extend the reach of your assistant. Adding custom actions to an agent requires several components, from understanding the OpenAPI specification endpoint to con- necting to a service. Therefore, before we add custom actions, we’ll build another GPT in the next section to assist us.

## 3.3.1 Creating an assistant to build an assistant

Given GPTs’ capabilities, it only makes sense that we use one to assist in building oth- ers. In this section, we’ll build a GPT that can help us create a service we can connect as a custom action to another GPT. And yes, we’ll even use an LLM to begin construct- ing our helper GPT. The following listing shows the prompt for creating the instructions for our helper GPT. This prompt is intended to generate the instructions for the assistant.

Listing 3.7 Prompting the helper design (in GPT Builder or ChatGPT)

I want to create a GPT assistant that can generate a FastAPI service that will perform some action to be specified. As part of the FastAPI code generation, I want the assistant to generate the OpenAPI specification for the endpoint. Please outline a set of instructions for this agent.

Listing 3.8 shows the bulk of the instructions generated for the prompt. The output was then modified and slightly updated with specific information and other details. Copy and paste those instructions from the file (assistant_builder.txt) into your GPT. Be sure to select the Code Interpreter capability also.

Listing 3.8 Custom action assistant instructions

This GPT is designed to assist users in generating FastAPI services tailored to specific actions, complete with the corresponding OpenAPI specifications for the endpoints. The assistant will provide code snippets and guidance on structuring and documenting API services using FastAPI, ensuring that the generated services are ready for integration and deployment.

1. Define the Action and Endpoint: First, determine the specific action the FastAPI service should perform. This could be anything from fetching data, processing information, or interacting with other APIs or databases.
2. Design the API Endpoint: Decide on the HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) and the endpoint URI structure. Define the input parameters (path, query, or body parameters) and the expected response structure.
3. Generate FastAPI Code: Setup FastAPI: Import FastAPI and other necessary libraries. Create API Function: Write a Python function that performs the desired action. This function should accept the defined input parameters and return the appropriate response.

<!-- Page 74 -->

**50** CHAPTER 3 ***Engaging GPT assistants***

4. Decorate the Function: Use FastAPI's decorators (e.g., @app.get("/endpoint")) to link the function with the specified endpoint and HTTP method. Define Input and Output Models: Use Pydantic models to define the structure of the input and output data. This ensures validation and serialization of the data.
5. Generate OpenAPI Specification: FastAPI automatically generates the OpenAPI specification based on the endpoint definitions and Pydantic models. Ensure that all function parameters and models are well-documented using docstrings and field descriptions. Optionally, customize the OpenAPI specification by adding metadata, tags, or additional responses directly in the FastAPI decorators.
6. Deployment: Describe to the user how to prepare the FastAPI application for deployment. Instruct them on how to use ngrok to deploy the **This uses ngrok as an**
**example to deploy the** service and host it on the user's local machine. **service locally.**

After preparing the assistant, ensure everything is set in the Configure panel (includ- ing setting the Code Interpreter checkbox), and then refresh your browser window. This will prepare the assistant for a new session. You can request the kind of service you want to build from here. Listing 3.9 shows the request to the Custom Action Assistant to create a daily task endpoint. If you understand how APIs work, you can suggest other options, such as POST. Of course, you can also ask the assistant to guide you and create your service.

Listing 3.9 Prompt requesting task endpoint service

I want to define a GET endpoint that replies with my list of daily tasks

After you enter the prompt, the assistant will generate the code and instructions for creating and running the FastAPI endpoint. The following listing shows an example of the code generated from the previous request.

Listing 3.10 **daily_tasks_api.py** (generated from assistant)

from fastapi import FastAPI from pydantic import BaseModel from typing import List

app = FastAPI()

class Task(BaseModel): **Use Pydantic to create** id: int **a type for the task.** description: str completed: bool **This is a static list of** **tasks to demonstrate.** tasks = [ Task(id=1, description="Buy groceries", completed=False), Task(id=2, description="Read a book", completed=True),

<!-- Page 75 -->

***3.3 Customizing a GPT and adding custom actions* 51**
Task(id=3, description="Complete FastAPI project", completed=False),]

@app.get("/tasks", response_model=List[Task]) **The tasks endpoint** async def get_tasks(): """ Retrieve a list of daily tasks. """ return tasks

Enter the code into Visual Studio Code (VS Code), and confirm that fastapi and uvicorn are installed with pip. Then, run the API using the command shown in the following listing, which runs the API in the chapter source file.

Listing 3.11 Running the API

uvicorn daily_tasks_api:app –reload **Change the name of the module/file if you’re using something different.**

Open a browser to [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs), the default location for the Swagger endpoint, as shown in figure 3.7.

**Navigate your browser to [http://127.0.0](http://127.0.0). l :8000/docs.**

**Click this link to open and view the OpenAPI specification in JSON.**

Figure 3.7 Navigating the Swagger docs and getting the openapi.json document

<!-- Page 76 -->

**52** CHAPTER 3 ***Engaging GPT assistants***

Clicking the /openapi.json link will display the OpenAPI specification for the end- point, as shown in listing 3.12 (JSON converted to YAML). You’ll need to copy and save this document for later use when setting up the custom action on the agent. The endpoint produces JSON, but you can also use specifications written in YAML.

Listing 3.12 OpenAPI specification for the task API

***3.3 Customizing a GPT and adding custom actions* 53**
instructions and help you set up ngrok, and run the application to open an endpoint to port 8000 on your machine, as shown in listing 3.13. If you change the port or use a different configuration, you must update it accordingly.

Listing 3.13 Running ngrok (following the instructions setup)

./ngrok authtoken <YOUR_AUTHTOKEN> **Enter your auth token** ./ngrok http 8000 **obtained from ngrok.com.** **Opens a tunnel on port 8000 to external internet traffic**

After you run ngrok, you’ll see an external URL that you can now use to access the ser- vice on your machine. Copy this URL for later use when setting up the assistant. In the next section, we’ll create the assistant that consumes this service as a custom action.

# 3.3.2 Connecting the custom action to an assistant

With the service up and running on your machine and accessible externally via the ngrok tunnel, we can build the new assistant. This time, we’ll create a simple assistant to help us organize our daily tasks, where the tasks will be accessible from our locally running task service. Open the GPT interface and the Configure panel, and copy and paste the instruc- tions shown in listing 3.14 into the new assistant. Be sure to name the assistant and enter a helpful description as well. Also, turn on the Code Interpreter capability to allow the assistant to create the final plot, showing the tasks.

Listing 3.14 Task Organizer (**task_organizer_assistant.txt**)

Task Organizer is designed to help the user prioritize their daily tasks based on urgency and time availability, providing structured guidance on how to categorize tasks by urgency and suggesting optimal time blocks for completing these tasks. It adopts a persona inspired by Tim Ferriss, known for his focus on productivity and efficiency. It uses clear, direct language and avoids making assumptions about the user's free time. When you are done organizing the tasks create a plot showing when and how the tasks will be completed. **This feature requires the Code Interpreter**

**to be enabled.**

Click the Create New Action button at the bottom of the panel. Figure 3.8 shows the interface for adding a custom action. You must copy and paste the OpenAPI specifica- tion for your service into the window. Then, you must add a new section called servers and populate that with your URL, as shown in the figure.

<!-- Page 78 -->

**54** CHAPTER 3 ***Engaging GPT assistants***

**Copy and paste the YAML or JSON specification into the window.**

**Add the servers section to the YAML, and enter the ngrok URL for your service.**

Figure 3.8 Adding a new custom action

After the specification is set, you can test it by clicking the Test button. This will run a test, and you’ll see the results shown in the conversation window, as shown in figure 3.9. After you’re satisfied, everything is set. Refresh your browser window to reset the session, and enter something like the prompt shown in listing 3.15. This will prompt the agent to call the service to get your daily tasks, summarize the output, and solve your task organization dilemma.

Listing 3.15 Task Organizer prompt

how should I organize my tasks for today?

The assistant should produce a plot of the task schedule at the end. If it gets this wrong or the formatting isn’t what you prefer, you can add instructions to specify the format/style the assistant should output.

<!-- Page 79 -->

***3.3 Customizing a GPT and adding custom actions* 55**
**Testing the endpoint**

**Returned list of tasks**

Figure 3.9 Testing the API service endpoint is correctly configured as a custom action

You can improve the service, but if you make any changes to the API, the specification in the assistant custom actions will need to be updated. From here, though, you can add custom action services run from your computer or hosted as a service.

NOTE Be aware that unknown users can activate custom actions if you pub- lish an assistant for public consumption, so don’t expose services that charge you a service fee or access private information unless that is your intention. Likewise, services opened through an ngrok tunnel will be exposed through the assistant, which may be of concern. Please be careful when publishing agents that consume custom actions.

Custom actions are a great way to add dynamic functionality to an assistant, whether for personal or commercial use. File uploads are a better option for providing an assis- tant with static knowledge. The next section will explore using file uploads to extend an assistant’s knowledge.

<!-- Page 80 -->

**56** CHAPTER 3 ***Engaging GPT assistants***

# 3.4 Extending an assistant’s knowledge using file uploads

If you’ve engaged with LLMs, you likely have heard about the retrieval augmented generation (RAG) pattern. Chapter 8 will explore RAG in detail for the application of both knowledge and memory. Detailed knowledge of RAG isn’t required to use the file upload capability, but if you need some foundation, check out that chapter. The GPT Assistants platform provides a knowledge capability called *file uploads*, which allows you to populate the GPT with a static knowledge base about anything in various formats. As of writing, the GPT Assistants platform allows you to upload up to 512 MB of documents. In the next two exercises, we’ll look at two different GPTs designed to assist users with consuming books.

## 3.4.1 Building the Calculus Made Easy GPT

Books and written knowledge will always be the backbone of our knowledge base. But reading text is a full-time concerted effort many people don’t have time for. Audio- books made consuming books again accessible; you could listen while multitasking, but not all books transitioned well to audio. Enter the world of AI and intelligent assistants. With GPTs, we can create an inter- active experience between the reader and the book. No longer is the reader forced to consume a book page by page but rather as a whole. To demonstrate this concept, we’ll build a GPT based on a classic math text called *Calculus Made Easy*, by Silvanus P. Thompson. The book is freely available through the Gutenberg Press website. While it’s more than a hundred years old, it still provides a solid material background.

NOTE If you’re serious about learning calculus but this assistant is still too advanced, check out a great book by Clifford A. Pickover called *Calculus and* *Pizza*. It’s a great book for learning calculus or just to get an excellent refresher. You could also try making your Calculus and Pizza assistant if you have an eBook version. Unfortunately, copyright laws would prevent you from publishing this GPT without permission.

Open ChatGPT, go to My GPTs, create a new GPT, click the Configure tab, and then upload the file, as shown in figure 3.10. Upload the book from the chapter’s source code folder: chapter _03/calculus_made_easy.pdf. This will add the book to the GPT’s knowledge. Scroll up and add the instructions shown in listing 3.16. The initial preamble text was generated by conversing with the GPT Builder. After updating the preamble text, a personality was added by asking ChatGPT for famous mathematicians. Then, finally, rules were added to provide additional guidance to the GPT on what explicit out- comes we want.

3) Always ask if the user wants to try a sample problem on their own. Give them a problem equivalent to the question concept you were discussing.
**Defining explicit conditions and rules can help better guide the GPT to your desire.**

After updating the assistant, you can try it in the preview window or the book version by searching for Calculus Made Easy in the GPT Store. Figure 3.11 shows a snipped example of interaction with the GPT. The figure shows that the GPT can generate plots to demonstrate concepts or ask questions. This GPT demonstrates the ability of an assistant to use a book as a companion teaching reference. Only a single book was uploaded in this exercise, but multiple books or other documents could be uploaded. As this feature and the technology mature, in the future, it may be conceivable that an entire course could be taught using a GPT. We’ll move away from technical and embrace fiction to demonstrate the use of knowledge. In the next section, we’ll look at how knowledge of file uploads can be used for search and reference.

The GPT Assistants platform’s file upload capability supports up to 512 MB of uploads for a single assistant. This feature alone provides powerful capabilities for document search and other applications in personal and small-to-medium business/ project sizes. Imagine uploading a whole collection of files. You can now search, compare, con- trast, organize, and collate all with one assistant. This feature alone within GPT Assis- tants will disrupt how we search for and analyze documents. In chapter 6, we’ll examine how direct access to the OpenAI Assistants API can increase the number of documents. For this next exercise, we’ll employ an assistant with knowledge of multiple books or documents. This technique could be applied to any supported document, but this assistant will consume classic texts about robots. We’ll name this assistant the Classic Robot Reads GPT. Start by creating a new GPT assistant in the ChatGPT interface. Then, upload the instructions in listing 3.17, and name and describe the assistant. These instructions were generated in part through the GPT Builder and then edited.

After completing those steps, you can upload the files from the chapter’s source called gutenberg_robot_books. Figure 3.12 demonstrates uploading multiple files at a time. The maximum number of files you can upload at a time will vary according to the sizes of the files.

**Uploads become accessible to the agent through knowledge patterns.**

**You can upload multiple files (about 5) at a time.**

Figure 3.12 Uploading documents to the assistant’s knowledge

You can start using it after uploading the documents, setting the instructions, and giv- ing the assistant a name and an image. Search is the most basic application of a knowl- edge assistant, and other use cases in the form of prompts are shown in table 3.1.

<!-- Page 85 -->

These use cases are just a sample of the many things possible with an AI knowledge assistant. While this feature may not be poised to disrupt enterprise search, it gives smaller organizations and individuals more access to their documents. It allows the creation of assistants as a form of knowledge that can be exposed publicly. In the next section, we’ll look at how to make assistants consumable by all.

# 3.5 Publishing your GPT

Once you’re happy with your GPT, you can use it or share it with others by providing a link. Consuming GPT assistants through ChatGPT currently requires a Plus subscrip- tion. To publish your GPT for others, click the Share button, and select your sharing option, as shown in figure 3.13.

**Only for you**

**Allows you to give the link to other users**

**Publishes your GPT to the store and makes it public**

**If you give a link to a GPT or make it public, usage of that assistant is taken** **from the user’s account and not yours.** Figure 3.13 GPT sharing options

<!-- Page 86 -->

**62** CHAPTER 3 ***Engaging GPT assistants***

Whether you share your GPT with friends and colleagues or publicly in the GPT Store, the assistant’s usage is taken from the account using it, not the publisher. This means if you have a particularly expensive GPT that generates a lot of images, for example, it won’t affect your account while others use it.

# 3.5.1 Expensive GPT assistants

At the time of writing, OpenAI tracks the resource usage of your ChatGPT account, including that used for GPTs. If you hit a resource usage limit and get blocked, your ChatGPT account will also be blocked. Blockages typically only last a couple of hours, but this can undoubtedly be more than a little annoying. Therefore, we want to ensure that users using your GPT don’t exceed their resource usage limits for regular use. Following is a list of features that increase resource usage while using the GPT:

- *Creating images*—Image generation is still a premium service, and successive image generation can quickly get your user blocked. It’s generally recommended that you inform your users of the potential risks and/or try to reduce how fre- quently images are generated.
- *Code interpretation*—This feature allows for file uploads and running of code for data analysis. If you think your users will require constant use of the coding tool, then inform them of the risk.
- *Vision, describing images*—If you’re building an assistant that uses vision to describe and extract information from the image, plan to use it sparingly.
- *File uploads*—If your GPT uses a lot of files or allows you to upload several files, this may cause blocks. As always, guide the user away from anything preventing them from enjoying your GPT. NOTE Moore’s Law states that computers will double in power every two years while costing half as much. LLMs are now doubling in power about every six months from optimization and increasing GPU power. This, combined with the cost being reduced by at least half in the same period, likely means cur- rent resource limits on vision and image-generation models won’t be consid- ered. However, services such as code interpretation and file uploads will likely remain the same.
Making your assistant aware of resource usage can be as simple as adding the rule shown in listing 3.18 to the assistant’s instructions. The instructions can be just a state- ment relaying the warning to the user and making the assistant aware. You could even ask the assistant to limit its usage of certain features.

Listing 3.18 Resource usage rule example

RULE: When generating images, ensure the user is aware that creating multiple images quickly could temporarily block their account.

<!-- Page 87 -->

***3.5 Publishing your GPT* 63**
Guiding your assistant to be more resource conscious in the end makes your assistant more usable. It also helps prevent angry users who unknowingly get blocked using your assistant. This may be important if you plan on releasing your GPT, but before that, let’s investigate the economics in the next section.

# 3.5.2 Understanding the economics of GPTs

Upon the release of GPT Assistants and the GPT Store, OpenAI announced the potential for a future profit-sharing program for those who published GPTs. While we’re still waiting to hear more about this program, many have speculated what this may look like. Some have suggested the store may return only 10% to 20% of profits to the build- ers. This is far less than the percentage on other app platforms but requires much less technical knowledge and fewer resources. The GPT Store is flooded with essentially free assistants, provided you have a Plus subscription, but that may change in the future. Regardless, there are also several reasons why you may want to build public GPTs:

- *Personal portfolio*—Perhaps you want to demonstrate your knowledge of prompt engineering or your ability to build the next wave of AI applications. Having a few GPTs in the GPT Store can help demonstrate your knowledge and ability to create useful AI applications.
- *Knowledge and experience*—If you have in-depth knowledge of a subject or topic, this can be a great way to package that as an assistant. These types of assistants will vary in popularity based on your area of expertise.
- *Cross-marketing and commercial tie-in*—This is becoming more common in the Store and provides companies the ability to lead customers using an assistant. As companies integrate more AI, this will certainly be more common.
- *Helpful assistant to your product/service*—Not all companies or organizations can sustain the cost of hosting chatbots. While consuming assistants is currently lim- ited to ChatGPT subscribers, they will likely be more accessible in the future. This may mean having GPTs for everything, perhaps like the internet’s early days where every company rushed to build a web presence.
While the current form of the GPT Store is for ChatGPT subscribers, if the current trend with OpenAI continues, we’ll likely see a fully public GPT Store. Public GPTs have the potential to disrupt the way we search, investigate products and services, and consume the internet. In the last section of this chapter, we’ll examine how to publish a GPT and some important considerations.

# 3.5.3 Releasing the GPT

Okay, you’re happy with your GPT and how it operates, and you see real benefit from giving it to others. Publishing GPTs for public (subscribers) consumption is easy, as shown in figure 3.14. After selecting the GPT Store as the option and clicking Save, you’ll now have the option to set the category and provide links back to you.

<!-- Page 88 -->

**64** CHAPTER 3 ***Engaging GPT assistants***

**You can set links to your social media and GitHub.**

**The area you want to Selecting this allows publish your GPT to you to view set links.**

Figure 3.14 Selecting the options after clicking Save to publish to the GPT Store

That is easy, so here are a few more things you’ll want to consider before publishing your GPT:

- *GPT description*—Create a good description, and you may even want to ask ChatGPT to help you build a description that increases the search engine opti- mization (SEO) of your GPT. GPTs are now showing up in Google searches, so good search engine optimization can help increase exposure to your assistant. A good description will also help users decide if they want to take the time to use your assistant.
- *The logo*—A nice, clean logo that identifies what your assistant does can undoubt- edly help. Logo design for GPTs is effectively a free service, but taking the time to iterate over a few images can help draw users to your assistant.
- *The category*—By default, the category will already be selected, but make sure it fits your assistant. If you feel it doesn’t, than change the category, and you may even want to select Other and define your own.
- *Links*—Be sure to set reference links for your social media and perhaps even a GitHub repository that you use to track problems for the GPT. Adding links to your GPT demonstrates to users that they can reach out to the builder if they encounter problems or have questions.

<!-- Page 89 -->

***3.6 Exercises* 65**
Further requirements may likely emerge as the GPT Store matures. The business model remains to be established, and other learnings will likely follow. Whether you decide to build GPTs for yourself or others, doing so can help improve your under- standing of how to build agents and assistants. As we’ll see throughout the rest of this book, GPT assistants are a useful foundation for your knowledge.

# Exploring multi-agent systems

## This chapter covers

- Building multi-agent systems using AutoGen Studio
- Building a simple multi-agent system
- Creating agents that can work collaboratively over a group chat
- Building an agent crew and multi-agent systems using CrewAI
- Extending the number of agents and exploring processing patterns with CrewAI Now let’s take a journey from AutoGen to CrewAI, two well-established multi- agent platforms. We’ll start with AutoGen, a Microsoft project that supports mul- tiple agents and provides a studio for working with them. We’ll explore a project from Microsoft called AutoGen, which supports multiple agents but also provides a studio to ease you into working with agents. From there, we’ll get more hands- on coding of AutoGen agents to solve tasks using conversations and group chat collaborations. Then, we’ll transition to CrewAI, a self-proposed enterprise agentic system that takes a different approach. CrewAI balances role-based and autonomous agents that

<!-- Page 93 -->

***4.1 Introducing multi-agent systems with AutoGen Studio* 69**
can be sequentially or hierarchically flexible task management systems. We’ll explore how CrewAI can solve diverse and complex problems. Multi-agent systems incorporate many of the same tools single-agent systems use but benefit from the ability to provide outside feedback and evaluation to other agents. This ability to support and criticize agent solutions internally gives multi-agent systems more power. We’ll explore an introduction to multi-agent systems, beginning with AutoGen Studio in the next section.

# 4.1 Introducing multi-agent systems with AutoGen Studio

AutoGen Studio is a powerful tool that employs multiple agents behind the scenes to solve tasks and problems a user directs. This tool has been used to develop some of the more complex code in this book. For that reason and others, it’s an excellent introduction to a practical multi-agent system.

Figure 4.1 shows a schematic diagram of the agent connection/communication

patterns AutoGen employs. AutoGen is a conversational multi-agent platform because communication is done using natural language. Natural language conversation seems to be the most natural pattern for agents to communicate, but it’s not the only method, as you’ll see later.

**AutoGen uses conversable agents, which communicate through conversations.**

Figure 4.1 How AutoGen agents communicate through conversations (Source: AutoGen)

AutoGen supports various conversational patterns, from group and hierarchical to the more common and simpler proxy communication. In proxy communication, one agent acts as a proxy and directs communication to relevant agents to complete tasks. A proxy is similar to a waiter taking orders and delivering them to the kitchen, which cooks the food. Then, the waiter serves the cooked food.

<!-- Page 94 -->

**70** CHAPTER 4 ***Exploring multi-agent systems***

The basic pattern in AutoGen uses a UserProxy and one or more assistant agents. Figure 4.2 shows the user proxy taking direction from a human and then directing an assistant agent enabled to write code to perform the tasks. Each time the assistant completes a task, the proxy agent reviews, evaluates, and provides feed- back to the assistant. This iteration loop continues until the proxy is satisfied with the results.

**Human communicates to the user proxy agent,**

**which communicates to other agents.**

**Evaluation and feedback loop is formed between**

**the proxy and the assistant.**

**Assistant agent undertakes completion**

**of the direct tasks.** LLM configured to write Python code

Figure 4.2 The user proxy agent and assistant agent communication (Source: AutoGen)

The benefit of the proxy is that it works to replace the required human feedback and evaluation, and, in most cases, it does a good job. While it doesn’t eliminate the need for human feedback and evaluation, it produces much more complete results overall. And, while the iteration loop is time consuming, it’s time you could be drinking a cof- fee or working on other tasks. AutoGen Studio is a tool developed by the AutoGen team that provides a helpful introduction to conversable agents. In the next exercise, we’ll install Studio and run some experiments to see how well the platform performs. These tools are still in a rapid development cycle, so if you encounter any problems, consult the documenta- tion on the AutoGen GitHub repository.

# 4.1.1 Installing and using AutoGen Studio

Open the chapter_04 folder in Visual Studio Code (VS Code), create a local Python virtual environment, and install the requirements.txt file. If you need assistance with this, consult appendix B to install all of this chapter’s exercise requirements. Open a terminal in VS Code (Ctrl-`, Cmd-`) pointing to your virtual environment, and run AutoGen Studio using the command shown in listing 4.1. You’ll first need to

<!-- Page 95 -->

***4.1 Introducing multi-agent systems with AutoGen Studio* 71**
define an environment variable for your OpenAI key. Because ports 8080 and 8081 are popular, and if you have other services running, change the port to 8082 or some- thing you choose.

Listing 4.1 Launching AutoGen Studio # set environment variable on Bash (Git Bash) export OPENAI_API_KEY=”<your API key>” **Use the appropriate** # sent environment variable with PowerShell **command for your** $env:VAR_NAME =”<your API key>" **terminal type.** autogenstudio ui --port 8081 **Change the port if you expect or experience a conflict on your machine.**

Navigate your browser to the AutoGen Studio interface shown in figure 4.3 (as of this writing). While there may be differences, one thing is for sure: the primary interface will still be chat. Enter a complex task that requires coding. The example used here is Create a plot showing the popularity of the term GPT Agents in Google search.

**The Playground tab is where you interact with agents. The Build tab is for creating new** **agents and skills, and the Gallery tab is for reviewing previous best output.**

**The proxy agent and assistant agent will not work together** **to complete the task.**

**Enter a task for the agents to work on.**

**You can create new sessions or review or** **continue previous sessions.**

Figure 4.3 Entering a task for the agents to work on in the AutoGen interface

<!-- Page 96 -->

**72** CHAPTER 4 ***Exploring multi-agent systems***

The agent assistant generates code snippets to perform or complete various subtasks as the agents work together through the task in the example. The user proxy agent then attempts to execute those code snippets and assesses the output. In many cases, prov- ing the code runs and produces the required output is sufficient for the user proxy agent to approve the task’s completion. If you encounter any problems with the assistant agent requests, ask the proxy agent to try a different method or another problem. This highlights a bigger problem with agentic systems using packages or libraries that have expired and no longer work. For this reason, it’s generally better to get agents to execute actions rather than build code to perform actions as tools.

TIP Executing AutoGen and AutoGen Studio using Docker is recommended, especially when working with code that may affect the operating system. Docker can isolate and virtualize the agents’ environment, thus isolating potentially harmful code. Using Docker can help alleviate any secondary windows or websites that may block the agent process from running.

Figure 4.4 shows the agent’s completion of the task. The proxy agent will collect any

generated code snippet, images, or other documents and append them to the message.

**Reply with TERMINATE if you are finished with this agent session. This**

**stop word is used to stop the session.**

**Generated code files and In this example, a Matplotlib other output will be plot was generated in a new**

Figure 4.4 The output after the agents complete the task

<!-- Page 97 -->

***4.1 Introducing multi-agent systems with AutoGen Studio* 73**
You can also review the agent conversation by opening the Agent Messages expander. In many cases, if you ask the agent to generate plots or applications, secondary win- dows will open showing those results. Amazingly, the agents will perform most tasks nicely and complete them well. Depending on the complexity of the task, you may need to further iterate with the proxy. Sometimes, an agent may only go so far to complete a task because it lacks the required skills. In the next section, we’ll look at how to add skills to agents.

# 4.1.2 Adding skills in AutoGen Studio

Skills and tools, or *actions,* as we refer to them in this book, are the primary means by which agents can extend themselves. Actions give agents the ability to execute code, call APIs, or even further evaluate and inspect generated output. AutoGen Studio cur- rently begins with just a basic set of tools to fetch web content or generate images.

NOTE Many agentic systems employ the practice of allowing agents to code to solve goals. However, we discovered that code can be easily broken, needs to be maintained, and can change quickly. Therefore, as we’ll discuss in later chap- ters, it’s better to provide agents with skills/actions/tools to solve problems.

In the following exercise scenario, we’ll add a skill/action to inspect an image using the OpenAI vision model. This will allow the proxy agent to provide feedback if we ask the assistant to generate an image with particular content. With AutoGen Studio running, go to the Build tab and click Skills, as shown in

figure 4.5. Then, click the New Skill button to open a code panel where you can

copy–paste code to. From this tab, you can also configure models, agents, and agent workflows. Enter the code shown in listing 4.2 and also provided in the book’s source code as describe_image.py. Copy and paste this code into the editor window, and then click the Save button at the bottom.

return response.json()["choices"][0]["message"] **Unpacking the response and** ["content"] **returning the content of the reply**

The describe_image function uses the OpenAI GPT-4 vision model to describe what is in the image. This skill can be paired with the existing generate_image skill as a quality assessment. The agents can confirm that the generated image matches the user’s requirements. After the skill is added, it must be added to the specific agent workflow and agent for use. Figure 4.6 demonstrates adding the new skill to the primary assistant agent in the general or default agent workflow. Now that the skill is added to the primary assistant, we can task the agent with cre- ating a specific image and validating it using the new describe_image skill. Because image generators notoriously struggle with correct text, we’ll create an exercise task to do just that. Enter the text shown in listing 4.3 to prompt the agents to create a book image cover for this book. We’ll explicitly say that the text needs to be correct and insist that the agent uses the new describe_image function to verify the image.

After the prompt is entered, wait for a while, and you may get to see some dialogue exchanged about the image generation and verification process. In the end, though, if everything works correctly, the agents will return with the results shown in figure 4.7. Remarkably, the agent coordination completed the task in just a couple of itera- tions. Along with the images, you can also see the various helper code snippets gener- ated to assist with task completion. AutoGen Studio is impressive in its ability to integrate skills that the agents can further adapt to complete some goal. The following section will show how these powerful agents are implemented in code.

# 4.2 Exploring AutoGen

While AutoGen Studio is a fantastic tool for understanding multi-agent systems, we must look into the code. Fortunately, coding multiple agent examples with AutoGen is simple and easy to run. We’ll cover the basic AutoGen setup in the next section.

## 4.2.1 Installing and consuming AutoGen

This next exercise will look at coding a basic multi-agent system that uses a user proxy and conversable agent. Before we do that, though, we want to make sure AutoGen is installed and configured correctly. Open a terminal in VS Code, and run the entire chapter 4 install directions per appendix B, or run the pip command in listing 4.4. If you’ve installed the require- ments.txt file, you’ll also be ready to run AutoGen.

Listing 4.4 Installing AutoGen pip install pyautogen

Next, copy the chapter_04/OAI_CONFIG_LIST.example to OAI_CONFIG_LIST, remov- ing .example from the file name. Then, open the new file in VS Code, and enter your

**78** CHAPTER 4 ***Exploring multi-agent systems***

OpenAI or Azure configuration in the OAI_CONFIG_LIST file in listing 4.5. Fill in your API key, model, and other details per your API service requirements. AutoGen will work with any model that adheres to the OpenAI client. That means you can use local LLMs via LM Studio or other services such as Groq, Hugging Face, and more.

Listing 4.5 **OAI_CONFIG_LIST**

[ **Select the model; GPT-4** { **is recommended.** "model": "gpt-4", "api_key": "<your OpenAI API key here>", **Use the service key you** "tags": ["gpt-4", "tool"] **would typically use.** }, { **Select the model; GPT-4 is recommended.** "model": "<your Azure OpenAI deployment name>", "api_key": "<your Azure OpenAI API key here>", **Use the service** "base_url": "<your Azure OpenAI API base here>", **key you would** "api_type": "azure", **typically use.** "api_version": "2024-02-15-preview" }] **Changing the base URL allows you to point to** **other services, not just Azure OpenAI.**

Now, we can look at the code for a basic multi-agent chat using the out-of-the-box UserProxy and ConversableAgent agents. Open autogen_start.py in VS Code, shown in the following listing, and review the parts before running the file.

Listing 4.6 **autogen_start.py**

from autogen import ConversableAgent, UserProxyAgent, config_list_from_json

**Loads your LLM** config_list = config_list_from_json( **configuration from the** env_or_file="OAI_CONFIG_LIST") **JSON file OAI_CONFIG_LIST**

assistant = ConversableAgent( "agent", **This agent talks** llm_config={"config_list": config_list}) **directly to the LLM.**

user_proxy = UserProxyAgent( **This agent proxies** "user", **conversations from the** code_execution_config={ **user to the assistant.** "work_dir": "working", "use_docker": False, }, **A chat is initiated with the** human_input_mode="ALWAYS", **assistant through the user_proxy to complete a task.** is_termination_msg=lambda x: x.get("content", "") .rstrip() .endswith("TERMINATE"), **Setting the termination message** ) **allows the agent to iterate.** user_proxy.initiate_chat(assistant, message="write a solution ➥ for fizz buzz in one line?")

Run the code by running the file in VS Code in the debugger (F5). The code in list- ing 4.6 uses a simple task to demonstrate code writing. Listing 4.7 shows a few examples to choose from. These coding tasks are also some of the author’s regular baselines to assess an LLMs’ strength in coding.

After the code starts in a few seconds, the assistant will respond to the proxy with a solution. At this time, the proxy will prompt you for feedback. Press Enter, essentially giving no feedback, and this will prompt the proxy to run the code to verify it operates as expected. Impressively, the proxy agent will even take cues to install required packages such as Pygame. Then it will run the code, and you’ll see the output in the terminal or as a new window or browser. You can play the game or use the interface if the code shelled a new window/browser. Note that the spawned window/browser won’t close on Windows and will require exiting the entire program. To avoid this problem, run the code through Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) or Docker. AutoGen explicitly recommends using Docker for code execution agents, and if you’re comfortable with containers, this is a good option. Either way, after the proxy generates and runs the code, the working_dir folder set earlier in listing 4.6 should now have a Python file with the code. This will allow you to run the code at your leisure, make changes, or even ask for improvements, as we’ll see. In the next section, we’ll look at how to improve the capabilities of the cod- ing agents.

# 4.2.2 Enhancing code output with agent critics

One powerful benefit of multi-agent systems is the multiple roles/personas you can automatically assign when completing tasks. Generating or helping to write code can be an excellent advantage to any developer, but what if that code was also reviewed and tested? In the next exercise, we’ll add another agent critic to our agent system to help with coding tasks. Open autogen_coding_critic.py, as shown in the following listing.

Listing 4.8 **autogen_coding_critic.py**

from autogen import AssistantAgent, UserProxyAgent, config_list_from_json

config_list = config_list_from_json(env_or_file="OAI_CONFIG_LIST")

user_proxy = UserProxyAgent( "user",

<!-- Page 104 -->

res = user_proxy.initiate_chat( recipient=engineer, message=task, **The proxy agent initiates a** max_turns=2, **chat with a max delay and** summary_method="last_msg" **explicit summary method.** )

Run the autogen_coding_critic.py file in VS Code in debug mode, and watch the dialog between the agents. This time, after the code returns, the critic will also be trig- gered to respond. Then, the critic will add comments and suggestions to improve the code. Nested chats work well for supporting and controlling agent interactions, but we’ll see a better approach in the following section. Before that though, we’ll review the importance of the AutoGen cache in the next section.

# 4.2.3 Understanding the AutoGen cache

AutoGen can consume many tokens over chat iterations as a conversable multi-agent platform. If you ask AutoGen to work through complex or novel problems, you may even encounter token limits on your LLM; because of this, AutoGen supports several methods to reduce token usage. AutoGen uses caching to store progress and reduce token usage. Caching is enabled by default, and you may have already encountered it. If you check your cur- rent working folder, you’ll notice a .cache folder, as shown in figure 4.8. Caching allows your agents to continue conversations if they get interrupted.

**A cache is denoted by the folder and contains a SQLite database**

**of message history.** **The folder code is output here.**

**Output code files are named** Figure 4.8 AutoGen cache **with temporary names.** and working folders

In code, you can control the cache folder for your agent’s run, as shown in listing 4.9. By wrapping the initiate_chat call with the with statement, you can control the

<!-- Page 106 -->

**82** CHAPTER 4 ***Exploring multi-agent systems***

location and seed for the cache. This will allow you to save and return to long-running AutoGen tasks in the future by just setting the cache_seed for the previous cache.

Listing 4.9 Setting the cache folder

with Cache.disk(cache_seed=42) as cache: **Setting the seed_cache** res = user_proxy.initiate_chat( **denotes the individual** recipient=engineer, **location.** message=task, max_turns=2, summary_method="last_msg", cache=cache, **Sets the cache as** ) **a parameter**

This caching ability allows you to continue operations from the previous cache loca- tion and captures previous runs. It can also be a great way to demonstrate and inspect how an agent conversation generated the results. In the next section, we’ll look at another conversational pattern in which AutoGen supports group chat.

# 4.3 Group chat with agents and AutoGen

One problem with chat delegation and nested chats or conversations is the convey- ance of information. If you’ve ever played the telephone game, you’ve witnessed this firsthand and experienced how quickly information can change over iterations. With agents, this is certainly no different, and chatting through nested or sequential con- versations can alter the task or even the desired result.

## The telephone game

The telephone game is a fun but educational game that demonstrates information and coherence loss. Children form a line, and the first child receives a message only they can hear. Then, in turn, the children verbally pass the message on to the next child, and so on. At the end, the last child announces the message to the whole group, which often isn’t even close to the same message.

To counter this, AutoGen provides a group chat, a mechanism by which agents par- ticipate in a shared conversation. This allows agents to review all past conversations and better collaborate on long-running and complex tasks.

Figure 4.9 shows the difference between nested and collaborative group chats. We

used the nested chat feature in the previous section to build a nested agent chat. In this section, we use the group chat to provide a more collaborative experience. Open autogen_coding_group.py with relevant parts, as shown in listing 4.10. The code is similar to the previous exercise but now introduces GroupChat and GroupChat- Manager. The agents and messages are held with the group chat, similar to a messaging channel in applications such as Slack or Discord. The chat manager coordinates the message responses to reduce conversation overlap.

**84** CHAPTER 4 ***Exploring multi-agent systems***

with Cache.disk(cache_seed=43) as cache: res = user_proxy.initiate_chat( recipient=manager, message=task, cache=cache, )

Run this exercise, and you’ll see how the agents collaborate. The engineer will now take feedback from the critic and undertake operations to address the critic’s sugges- tions. This also allows the proxy to engage in all of the conversation. Group conversations are an excellent way to strengthen your agents’ abilities as they collaborate on tasks. However, they are also substantially more verbose and token expensive. Of course, as LLMs mature, so do the size of their context token windows and the price of token processing. As token windows increase, concerns over token consumption may eventually go away. AutoGen is a powerful multi-agent platform that can be experienced using a web interface or code. Whatever your preference, this agent collaboration tool is an excel- lent platform for building code or other complex tasks. Of course, it isn’t the only plat- form, as you’ll see in the next section, where we explore a newcomer called CrewAI.

# 4.4 Building an agent crew with CrewAI

CrewAI is relatively new to the realm of multi-agent systems. Where AutoGen was initially developed from research and then extended, CrewAI is built with enterprise systems in mind. As such, the platform is more robust, making it less extensible in some areas. With CrewAI, you build a crew of agents to focus on specific areas of a task goal. Unlike AutoGen, CrewAI doesn’t require the use of the user proxy agent but instead assumes the agents only work among themselves.

Figure 4.10 shows the main elements of the CrewAI platform, how they connect

together, and their primary function. It shows a sequential-processing agent system with generic researcher and writer agents. Agents are assigned tasks that may also include tools or memory to assist them. CrewAI supports two primary forms of processing: sequential and hierarchical. Fig- ure 4.10 shows the sequential process by iterating across the given agents and their associated tasks. In the next section, we dig into some code to set up a crew and employ it to complete a goal and create a good joke.

## 4.4.1 Creating a jokester crew of CrewAI agents

CrewAI requires more setup than AutoGen, but this also allows for more control and additional guides, which provide more specific context to guide the agents in com- pleting the given task. This isn’t without problems, but it does offer more control than AutoGen out of the box. Open crewai_introduction.py in VS Code and look at the top section, as shown in listing 4.11. Many settings are required to configure an agent, including the role,

|Building an agent crew with CrewAI Now, we can see how everything comes together as the Crew at the bottom of the file, as shown in listing 4.13.

As you can probably tell by now, the goal of this agent system is to craft jokes related to AI engineering. Here are some of the fun- Why don’t AI engineers play hide and seek with their algorithms? Because no matter where they hide, the algorithms always find them in the “overfitting” What is an AI engineer’s favorite song? “I just called to say I love you... and to Why was the AI engineer broke? Because he spent all his money on cookies, but Before you run more iterations of the joke crew, you should read the next section. This section shows how to add observability to the multi-agent system. Observing a complex assemblage such as a multi-agent system is critical to understand- ing the myriad of problems that can happen. Observability through application tracing is a key element of any complex system, especially one engaged in enterprise use. CrewAI supports connecting to a specialized agent operations platform appropri- ately called AgentOps. This observability platform is generic and designed to support|can work on into the crew|Defining how the agents will interact Whether the system should use memory; needs to be set if agents/tasks have it on Whether the system should use a cache, similar to AutoGen Maximum requests per minute the system should limit itself to Whether the crew should share information, similar to group chat|

ute (max_rpm), and whether the crew shares.

Listing 4.13 **crewai_introduction.py**

crew = Crew( agents=[joke_researcher, joke_writer], tasks=[research_task, write_task], process=Process.sequential, memory=True, cache=True, max_rpm=100, share_crew=True, )

**88** CHAPTER 4 ***Exploring multi-agent systems***

observability with any agent platform specific to LLM usage. Currently, no pricing or commercialization details are available. Connecting to AgentOps is as simple as installing the package, getting an API key, and adding a line of code to your crew setup. This next exercise will go through the steps to connect and run AgentOps. Listing 4.14 shows installing the agentops package using pip. You can install the package alone or as an additional component of the crewai package. Remember that AgentOps can also be connected to other agent platforms for observability.

Listing 4.14 Installing AgentOps

pip install agentops

or as an option with CrewAI

pip install crewai[agentops]

Before using AgentOps, you need to sign up for an API key. Following are the general steps to sign up for a key at the time of writing: 1 Visit [https://app.agentops.ai](https://app.agentops.ai) in your browser. 2 Sign up for an account. 3 Create a project, or use the default. 4 Go to Settings > Projects and API Keys. 5 Copy and/or generate a new API key; this will copy the key to your browser. 6 Paste the key to your .env file in your project. After the API key is copied, it should resemble the example shown in the following listing.

Listing 4.15 **env.**: Adding an AgentOps key

AGENTOPS_API_KEY="your API key"

Now, we need to add a few lines of code to the CrewAI script. Listing 4.16 shows the additions as they are added to the crewai_agentops.py file. When creating your own scripts, all you need to do is add the agentops package and initialize it when using CrewAI.

Listing 4.16 **crewai_agentops.py** (AgentOps additions)

<!-- Page 113 -->

***4.4 Building an agent crew with CrewAI* 89**
Run the crewai_agentops.py file in VS Code (F5), and watch the agents work as before. However, you can now go to the AgentOps dashboard and view the agent interactions at various levels.

Figure 4.11 shows the dashboard for running the joke crew to create the best joke.

Several statistics include total duration, the run environment, prompt and completion tokens, LLM call timings, and estimated cost. Seeing the cost can be both sobering and indicative of how verbose agent conversations can become.

**Various statistics are captured with respect to the entire agent conversation**

**sequence, including costs.** **System information is captured as well.**

**You can even track individual** **LLM calls, actions, and tool use.**

**Prompts and replies are also captured for all iterations.**

Figure 4.11 The AgentOps dashboard for running the joke crew

The AgentOps platform is an excellent addition to any agent platform. While it’s built into CrewAI, it’s helpful that the observability could be added to AutoGen or other frameworks. Another attractive thing about AgentOps is that it’s dedicated to observing agent interactions and not transforming from a machine learning operations platform. In the future, we’ll likely see the spawn of more agent observability patterns. One benefit that can’t be overstated is the cost observation that an observability platform can provide. Did you notice in figure 4.11 that creating a single joke costs a little over 50 cents? Agents can be very powerful, but they can also become very costly, and it’s essential to observe what those costs are in terms of practicality and commer- cialization.

<!-- Page 114 -->

**90** CHAPTER 4 ***Exploring multi-agent systems***

In the last section of this chapter, we’ll return to CrewAI and revisit building agents that can code games. This will provide an excellent comparison between the capabilities of AutoGen and CrewAI.

# 4.5 Revisiting coding agents with CrewAI

A great way to compare capabilities between multi-agent platforms is to implement similar tasks in a bot. In this next set of exercises, we’ll employ CrewAI as a game pro- gramming team. Of course, this could be adapted to other coding tasks as well. Open crewai_coding_crew.py in VS Code, and we’ll first review the agent section in listing 4.17. Here, we’re creating a senior engineer, a QA engineer, and a chief QA engineer with a role, goal, and backstory.

Listing 4.17 **crewai_coding_crew.py** (agent section)

print("## Welcome to the Game Crew") **Allows the user** print("-------------------------------") **to input the** game = input("What is the game you would like to build? **instructions for** ➥ What will be the mechanics?\n") **their game**

senior_engineer_agent = Agent( role="Senior Software Engineer", goal="Create software as needed", backstory=dedent( """ You are a Senior Software Engineer at a leading tech think tank. Your expertise in programming in python. and do your best to produce perfect code """ ), allow_delegation=False, verbose=True, )

qa_engineer_agent = Agent( role="Software Quality Control Engineer", goal="create prefect code, by analizing the code ➥ that is given for errors", backstory=dedent( """ You are a software engineer that specializes in checking code for errors. You have an eye for detail and a knack for finding hidden bugs. You check for missing imports, variable declarations, mismatched brackets and syntax errors. You also check for security vulnerabilities, and logic errors """ ), allow_delegation=False, verbose=True, )

<!-- Page 115 -->

***4.5 Revisiting coding agents with CrewAI* 91**
chief_qa_engineer_agent = Agent( role="Chief Software Quality Control Engineer", goal="Ensure that the code does the job that it is supposed to do", backstory=dedent( """ You are a Chief Software Quality Control Engineer at a leading tech think tank. You are responsible for ensuring that the code that is written does the job that it is supposed to do. You are responsible for checking the code for errors and ensuring that it is of the highest quality. """ ), **Only the chief QA engineer** allow_delegation=True, **can delegate tasks.** verbose=True, )

Scrolling down in the file will display the agent tasks, as shown in listing 4.18. The task descriptions and expected output should be easy to follow. Again, each agent has a specific task to provide better context when working to complete the task.

Listing 4.18 **crewai_coding_crew.py** (task section)

code_task = Task( description=f""" You will create a game using python, these are the instructions: Instructions ------------ {game} You will write the code for the game using python.""", expected_output="Your Final answer must be the ➥ full python code, only the python code and nothing else.", agent=senior_engineer_agent, ) **The game instructions** **are substituted into the** qa_task = Task( **prompt using Python** description=f"""You are helping create a game **formatting.** ➥ using python, these are the instructions: Instructions ------------ {game} Using the code you got, check for errors.

evaluate_task = Task( description=f"""You are helping create a game ➥ using python, these are the instructions: Instructions ------------ {game}

<!-- Page 116 -->

**92** CHAPTER 4 ***Exploring multi-agent systems***

You will look over the code to insure that it is complete and does the job that it is supposed to do. """, expected_output="Your Final answer must be the ➥ corrected a full python code, only the python code and nothing else.", agent=chief_qa_engineer_agent, )

Finally, we can see how this comes together by going to the bottom of the file, as shown in listing 4.19. This crew configuration is much like what we’ve seen before. Each agent and task are added, as well as the verbose and process attributes. For this example, we’ll continue to use sequential methods.

Listing 4.19 **crewai_coding_crew.py** (crew section)

crew = Crew( agents=[senior_engineer_agent, qa_engineer_agent, chief_qa_engineer_agent], tasks=[code_task, qa_task, evaluate_task], verbose=2, process=Process.sequential, **Process is sequential.** )

# Get your crew to work! result = crew.kickoff() **No additional context is provided in the kickoff.**

print("######################") print(result)

When you run the VS Code (F5) file, you’ll be prompted to enter the instructions for writing a game. Enter some instructions, perhaps the snake game or another game you choose. Then, let the agents work, and observe what they produce. With the addition of the chief QA engineer, the results will generally look better than what was produced with AutoGen, at least out of the box. If you review the code, you’ll see that it generally follows good patterns and, in some cases, may even include tests and unit tests. Before we finish the chapter, we’ll make one last change to the crew’s processing pattern. Previously, we employed sequential processing, as shown in figure 4.10. Fig- ure 4.12 shows what hierarchical processing looks like in CrewAI. Adding this manager is a relatively simple process. Listing 4.20 shows the addi- tional code changes to a new file that uses the coding crew in a hierarchical method. Aside from importing a class for connecting to OpenAI from LangChain, the other addition is adding this class as the crew manger, manager_llm.

Run this file in VS Code (F5). When prompted, enter a game you want to create. Try using the same game you tried with AutoGen; the snake game is also a good baseline example. Observe the agents work through the code and review it repeatedly for problems. After you run the file, you can also jump on AgentOps to review the cost of this run. Chances are, it will cost over double what it would have without the agent man- ager. The output will also likely not be significantly better. This is the trap of building agent systems without understanding how quickly things can spiral. An example of this spiral that often happens when agents continually iterate over the same actions is frequently repeating tasks. You can view this problem in AgentOps, as shown in figure 4.13, by viewing the Repeat Thoughts plot.

**Plot indicates the repetition of the same thoughts in an**

**agent interaction.**

1.5 1
0.5
Figure 4.13 The repetition of thoughts as they occurred within an agent run

The Repeat Thoughts plot from AgentOps is an excellent way to measure the repeti- tion your agent system encounters. Overly repetitive thought patterns typically mean the agent isn’t being decisive enough and instead keeps trying to generate a different answer. If you encounter this problem, you want to change the agents’ pro- cessing patterns, tasks, and goals. You may even want to alter the system’s type and number of agents. Multi-agent systems are an excellent way to break up work in terms of work pat- terns of jobs and tasks. Generally, the job role is allocated to an agent role/persona,

and the tasks it needs to complete may be implicit, as in AutoGen, or more explicit, as in CrewAI. In this chapter, we covered many useful tools and platforms that you can use right away to improve your work, life, and more. That completes our journey through multi- agent platforms, but it doesn’t conclude our exploration and use of multiple agents, as we’ll discover in later chapters.

# 4.6 Exercises

Use the following exercises to improve your knowledge of the material:

# Summary

- AutoGen, developed by Microsoft, is a conversational multi-agent platform that employs a variety of agent types, such as user proxies and assistant agents, to facilitate task execution through natural language interactions.
- AutoGen Studio acts as a development environment that allows users to create, test, and manage multi-agent systems, enhancing the usability of AutoGen.
- AutoGen supports multiple communication patterns, including group chats and hierarchical and proxy communications. Proxy communication involves a primary agent (proxy) that interfaces between the user and other agents to streamline task completion.
- CrewAI offers a structured approach to building multi-agent systems with a focus on enterprise applications. It emphasizes role-based and autonomous agent func- tionalities, allowing for flexible, sequential, or hierarchical task management.
- Practical exercises in the chapter illustrate how to set up and use AutoGen Stu- dio, including installing necessary components and running basic multi-agent systems.
- Agents in AutoGen can be equipped with specific skills to perform tasks such as code generation, image analysis, and data retrieval, thereby broadening their application scope.
- CrewAI is distinguished by its ability to structure agent interactions more rigidly than AutoGen, which can be advantageous in settings that require precise and controlled agent behavior.
- CrewAI supports integrating memory and tools for agents to consume through task completion.

<!-- Page 121 -->

***Summary* 97**

- CrewAI supports integration with observability tools such as AgentOps, which provides insights into agent performance, interaction efficiency, and cost management.
- AgentOps is an agent observability platform that can help you easily monitor extensive agent interactions.

***5.1 Defining agent actions* 99**
# 5.1 Defining agent actions

ChatGPT plugins were first introduced to provide a session with abilities, skills, or tools. With a plugin, you can search the web or create spreadsheets or graphs. Plugins provide ChatGPT with the means to extend the platform.

Figure 5.1 shows how a ChatGPT plugin works. In this example, a new movie rec-

ommender plugin has been installed in ChatGPT. When a user asks ChatGPT to rec- ommend a new movie, the large language model (LLM) recognizes that it has a plugin to manage that action. It then breaks down the user request into actionable parameters, which it passes to the new movie recommender.

responds to the recommender, which passes this back to ChatGPT. ChatGPT then responds to the user with the recommended request. We can think of plugins as proxies for actions. A plugin generally encapsulates one or more abilities, such as calling an API or scraping a website. Actions, therefore, are extensions of plugins—they give a plugin its abilities. AI agents can be considered plugins and consumers of plugins, tools, skills, and other agents. Adding skills, functions, and tools to an agent/plugin allows it to exe- cute well-defined actions—figure 5.2 highlights where agent actions occur and their interaction with LLMs and other systems.

Figure 5.2 How an agent uses actions to perform external tasks

An agent action is an ability that allows it to use a function, skill, or tool. What gets confusing is that different frameworks use different terminology. We’ll define an action as anything an agent can do to establish some basic definitions. ChatGPT plugins and functions represent an actionable ability that ChatGPT or an agent system can use to perform additional actions. Now let’s examine the basis for OpenAI plugins and the function definition.

<!-- Page 125 -->

***5.2 Executing OpenAI functions* 101**
# 5.2 Executing OpenAI functions

OpenAI, with the enablement of plugins, introduced a structure specification for defin- ing the interface between functions/plugins an LLM could action. This specification is becoming a standard that LLM systems can follow to provide actionable systems. These same function definitions are now also being used to define plugins for ChatGPT and other systems. Next, we’ll explore how to use functions directly with an LLM call.

## 5.2.1 Adding functions to LLM API calls

Figure 5.3 demonstrates how an LLM recognizes and uses the function definition to

cast its response as the function call.

Figure 5.3 How a single LLM request, including tools, gets interpreted by an LLM

Listing 5.1 shows the details of an LLM API call using tools and a function definition. Adding a function definition allows the LLM to reply regarding the function’s input parameters. This means the LLM will identify the correct function and parse the rele- vant parameters for the user’s request.

Listing 5.1 **first_function.py** (API call)

response = client.chat.completions.create( model="gpt-4-1106-preview", messages=[{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."}, {"role": "user", "content": user_message}],

<!-- Page 126 -->

**You can even describe in terms**

**Previously defined function**

**description of what** "description": "Provide a … topic.",

"The topic,… for.",

To see how this works, open Visual Studio Code (VS Code) to the book’s source code folder: chapter_4/first_function.py. It’s a good practice to open the relevant chapter folder in VS Code to create a new Python environment and install the requirements.txt

Before starting, correctly set up an .env file in the chapter_4 folder with your API credentials. Function calling is an extra capability provided by the LLM com- mercial service. At the time of writing, this feature wasn’t an option for open

Next, we’ll look at the bottom of the code in first_function.py, as shown in list- ing 5.2. Here are just two examples of calls made to an LLM using the request previ- ously specified in listing 5.1. Here, each request shows the generated output from

user = "Can you please recommend me a time travel movie?"

<!-- Page 127 -->

***5.2 Executing OpenAI functions* 103**
**###Output** **Returned in** Function(arguments='{"topic":"time travel movie"}', **the name of the** name='recommend') **function to call and the extracted** user = "Can you please recommend me a good time travel movie?" **input parameters** response = ask_chatgpt(user) print(response) **Previously defined function** **###Output** Function(arguments='{"topic":"time travel movie", "rating":"good"}', name='recommend') **Returned in the name of the function to call and the extracted input parameters**

Run the first_function.py Python script in VS Code using the debugger (F5) or the terminal to see the same results. Here, the LLM parses the input request to match any registered tools. In this case, the tool is the single function definition, that is, the rec- ommended function. The LLM extracts the input parameters from this function and parses those from the request. Then, it replies with the named function and desig- nated input parameters.

NOTE The actual function isn’t being called. The LLM only returns the sug- gested function and the relevant input parameters. The name and parame- ters must be extracted and passed into a function matching the signature to act on the function. We’ll look at an example of this in the next section.

# 5.2.2 Actioning function calls

Now that we understand that an LLM doesn’t execute the function or plugin directly, we can look at an example that executes the tools. Keeping with the recommender theme, we’ll look at another example that adds a Python function for simple recommendations.

Figure 5.4 shows how this simple example will work. We’ll submit a single request

that includes a tool function definition, asking for three recommendations. The LLM, in turn, will reply with the three function calls with input parameters (time travel, rec- ipe, and gift). The results from executing the functions are then passed back to the LLM, which converts them back to natural language and returns a reply. Now that we understand the example, open parallel_functions.py in VS Code. Listing 5.3 shows the Python function that you want to call to give recommendations.

<!-- Page 128 -->

**104** CHAPTER 5 ***Empowering agents with actions***

Return results of all three recommendations in natural language.

Figure 5.4 A sample request returns three tool function calls and then submits the results back to the LLM

to return a natural language response.

Listing 5.3 **parallel_functions.py** (recommend function)

def recommend(topic, rating="good"): if "time travel" in topic.lower(): return json.dumps({"topic": "time travel", "recommendation": "Back to the Future", **Checks to see if the** "rating": rating}) **string is** elif "recipe" in topic.lower(): **contained** return json.dumps({"topic": "recipe", **within the** "recommendation": "The best thing … ate.", **topic input** "rating": rating}) elif "gift" in topic.lower(): return json.dumps({"topic": "gift", "recommendation": "A glorious new...", **If no topic is** "rating": rating}) **detected, returns** else: **the default** return json.dumps({"topic": topic, "recommendation": "unknown"}) **Returns a** **JSON object**

Next, we’ll look at the function called run_conversation, where all the work starts with the request construction.

Listing 5.4 **parallel_functions.py** (**run_conversation**, **request**)

user = """Can you please make recommendations for the following:

1. Time travel movies
2. Recipes

<!-- Page 129 -->

***5.2 Executing OpenAI functions* 105**

**The user message** messages = [{"role": "user", "content": user}] **asks for three** tools = [ **recommendations.** { "type": "function", "function": { **Note that there is no** **system message.** "name": "recommend", "description": "Provide a recommendation for any topic.", **Adds the function** "parameters": { **definition to the tools** "type": "object", **part of the request** "properties": { "topic": { "type": "string", "description": "The topic, … recommendation for.", }, "rating": { "type": "string", "description": "The rating … was given.", "enum": ["good", "bad", "terrible"] }, }, "required": ["topic"], }, }, }]

Listing 5.5 shows the request being made, which we’ve covered before, but there are a few things to note. This call uses a lower model such as GPT-3.5 because delegating functions is a more straightforward task and can be done using older, cheaper, less sophisticated language models.

Listing 5.5 **parallel_functions.py** (**run_conversation**, API call)

## LLMs that delegate to functions

response = client.chat.completions.create( **can be simpler models.** model="gpt-3.5-turbo-1106", messages=messages,

## Adds the messages and tools definitions

tools=tools, tool_choice="auto", **auto is the default.** ) response_message = response.choices[0].message **The returned message from the LLM**

At this point, after the API call, the response should hold the information for the required function calls. Remember, we asked the LLM to provide us with three recom- mendations, which means it should also provide us with three function call outputs, as shown in the following listing.

<!-- Page 130 -->

***Empowering agents with actions*** **106** CHAPTER 5

Listing 5.6 **parallel_functions.py** (

tool_calls = response_message.tool_calls if tool_calls: available_functions = { "recommend": recommend, }

the model for tool_call in tool_calls: function_name = tool_call.function.name

function_response = function_to_call( topic=function_args.get("topic"), rating=function_args.get("rating"), ) messages.append( { "tool_call_id": tool_call.id, "role": "tool", "name": function_name, "content": function_response, }

return second_response.choices[0].message.content

The tool call outputs and the calls to the recommender function results are appended to the messages. Notice how messages now also contain the history of the first call. This is then passed back to the LLM to construct a reply in natural language. Debug this example in VS Code by pressing the F5 key with the file open. The fol- lowing listing shows the output of running parallel_functions.py.

For more advanced applications, the func- tions could do any number of things, from scraping websites to calling search engines

***5.3 Introducing Semantic Kernel* 107**
Functions are an excellent way to cast outputs for a particular task. However, the work of handling functions or tools and making secondary calls can be done in a cleaner and more efficient way. The following section will uncover a more robust sys- tem of adding actions to agents.

# 5.3 Introducing Semantic Kernel

Semantic Kernel (SK) is another open source project from Microsoft intended to help build AI applications, which we call agents. At its core, the project is best used to define actions, or what the platform calls *semantic plugins*, which are wrappers for skills and functions.

Figure 5.5 shows how the SK can be used as a plugin and a consumer of OpenAI

plugins. The SK relies on the OpenAI plugin definition to define a plugin. That way, it can consume and publish itself or other plugins to other systems.

|(native function)|(semantic function)|(native plugin)|

Figure 5.5 How the Semantic Kernel integrates as a plugin and can also consume plugins

An OpenAI plugin definition maps precisely to the function definitions in listing 5.4. This means that SK is the orchestrator of API tool calls, aka plugins. That also means that SK can help organize multiple plugins with a chat interface or an agent.

NOTE The team at SK originally labeled the functional modules as *skills.* How- ever, to be more consistent with OpenAI, they have since renamed *skills* to

<!-- Page 132 -->

**108** CHAPTER 5 ***Empowering agents with actions***

*plugins.* What is more confusing is that the code still uses the term *skills.* There- fore, throughout this chapter, we’ll use *skills* and *plugins* to mean the same thing.

SK is a useful tool for managing multiple plugins (actions for agents) and, as we’ll see later, can also assist with memory and planning tools. For this chapter, we’ll focus on the actions/plugins. In the next section, we look at how to get started using SK.

# 5.3.1 Getting started with SK semantic functions

SK is easy to install and works within Python, Java, and C#. This is excellent news as it also allows plugins developed in one language to be consumed in a different language. How- ever, you can’t yet develop a native function in one language and use it in another. We’ll continue from where we left off for the Python environment using the chapter_4 workspace in VS Code. Be sure you have a workspace configured if you want to explore and run any examples. Listing 5.8 shows how to install SK from a terminal within VS Code. You can also install the SK extension for VS Code. The extension can be a helpful tool to create plugins/skills, but it isn’t required.

Listing 5.8 Installing Semantic Kernel

pip uninstall semantic-kernel **Uninstalls any previous installations of SK**

git clone [https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel.git](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel.git) **Clones the** cd semantic-kernel/python **Changes to the source folder** **repository to a local folder**

pip install -e. **Installs the editable package from the source folder**

Once you finish the installation, open SK_connecting.py in VS Code. Listing 5.9 shows a demo of running an example quickly through SK. The example creates a chat completion service using either OpenAI or Azure OpenAI.

Listing 5.9 **SK_connecting.py**

import semantic_kernel as sk **Sets the service you’re using** selected_service = "OpenAI" **(OpenAI or Azure OpenAI)** kernel = sk.Kernel() **Creates the kernel** service_id = None if selected_service == "OpenAI": from semantic_kernel.connectors.ai.open_ai import OpenAIChatCompletion

api_key, org_id = sk.openai_settings_from_dot_env() **Loads secrets** service_id = "oai_chat_gpt" **from the .env file** kernel.add_service( **and sets them on** OpenAIChatCompletion( **the chat service** service_id=service_id, ai_model_id="gpt-3.5-turbo-1106",

<!-- Page 133 -->

***5.3 Introducing Semantic Kernel* 109**
api_key=api_key, org_id=org_id, ), ) elif selected_service == "AzureOpenAI": from semantic_kernel.connectors.ai.open_ai import AzureChatCompletion

deployment, api_key, endpoint = ➥ sk.azure_openai_settings_from_dot_env() **Loads secrets** service_id = "aoai_chat_completion" **from the .env file** kernel.add_service( **and sets them on** AzureChatCompletion( **the chat service** service_id=service_id, deployment_name=deployment, endpoint=endpoint, api_key=api_key, ), )

#This function is currently broken async def run_prompt(): result = await kernel.invoke_prompt( **Invokes the** ➥ prompt="recommend a movie about **prompt** ➥ time travel") print(result)

**Calls the function** # Use asyncio.run to execute the async function **asynchronously** asyncio.run(run_prompt())

###Output One highly recommended time travel movie is "Back to the Future" (1985) directed by Robert Zemeckis. This classic film follows the adventures of teenager Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox)…

Run the example by pressing F5 (debugging), and you should see an output similar to listing 5.9. This example demonstrates how a semantic function can be created with SK and executed. A semantic function is the equivalent of a prompt template in prompt flow, another Microsoft tool. In this example, we define a simple prompt as a function. It’s important to note that this semantic function isn’t defined as a plugin. How- ever, the kernel can create the function as a self-contained semantic element that can be executed against an LLM. Semantic functions can be used alone or regis- tered as plugins, as you’ll see later. Let’s jump to the next section, where we intro- duce contextual variables.

# 5.3.2 Semantic functions and context variables

Expanding on the previous example, we can look at adding contextual variables to the semantic function. This pattern of adding placeholders to prompt templates is one we’ll review over and over. In this example, we look at a prompt template that has placeholders for subject, genre, format, and custom.

<!-- Page 134 -->

**110** CHAPTER 5 ***Empowering agents with actions***

Open SK_context_variables.py in VS Code, as shown in the next listing. The prompt is equivalent to setting aside a system and user section of the prompt.

Listing 5.10 **SK_context_variables.py**

#top section omitted… **Defines a prompt** prompt = """ **with placeholders** system:

You have vast knowledge of everything and can recommend anything provided you are given the following criteria, the subject, genre, format and any other custom information.

user: Please recommend a {{$format}} with the subject {{$subject}} and {{$genre}}. Include the following custom information: {{$custom}} """

prompt_template_config = sk.PromptTemplateConfig( **Configures a** template=prompt, **prompt template** name="tldr", **and input variable** template_format="semantic-kernel", **definitions** input_variables=[ InputVariable( name="format", description="The format to recommend", is_required=True ), InputVariable( name="suject", description="The subject to recommend", is_required=True ), InputVariable( name="genre", description="The genre to recommend", is_required=True ), InputVariable( name="custom", description="Any custom information [CA] to enhance the recommendation", is_required=True, ),], execution_settings=execution_settings, ) **Creates a kernel** **function from the prompt** recommend_function = kernel.create_function_from_prompt( prompt_template_config=prompt_template_config, function_name="Recommend_Movies", plugin_name="Recommendation", )

<!-- Page 135 -->

***5.4 Synergizing semantic and native functions* 111**
async def run_recommendation( subject="time travel", **Creates an asynchronous** format="movie", **function to wrap the function call** genre="medieval", custom="must be a comedy" ): recommendation = await kernel.invoke( recommend_function, sk.KernelArguments(subject=subject, format=format, genre=genre, custom=custom), ) print(recommendation) **Sets the kernel**

**function** # Use asyncio.run to execute the async function **arguments** asyncio.run(run_recommendation())

###Output One movie that fits the criteria of being about time travel, set in a medieval period, and being a comedy is "The Visitors" (Les Visiteurs) from 1993. This French film, directed by Jean-Marie Poiré, follows a knight and his squire who are transported to the modern era by a wizard’s spell gone wrong.…

Go ahead and debug this example (F5), and wait for the output to be generated. That is the basis for setting up SK and creating and exercising semantic functions. In the next section, we move on to see how a semantic function can be registered as a skill/plugin.

# 5.4 Synergizing semantic and native functions

Semantic functions encapsulate a prompt/profile and execute through interaction with an LLM. Native functions are the encapsulation of code that may perform anything from scraping websites to searching the web. Both semantic and native functions can register as plugins/skills in the SK kernel. A function, semantic or native, can be registered as a plugin and used the same way we registered the earlier function directly with our API calls. When a function is registered as a plugin, it becomes accessible to chat or agent interfaces, depending on the use case. The next section looks at how a semantic function is created and regis- tered with the kernel.

## 5.4.1 Creating and registering a semantic skill/plugin

The VS Code extension for SK provides helpful tools for creating plugins/skills. In this section, we’ll use the SK extension to create a plugin/skill and then edit the com- ponents of that extension. After that, we’ll register and execute the plugin in the SK.

Figure 5.6 shows the process for creating a new skill within VS Code using the SK

extension. (Refer to appendix B for directions if you need to install this extension.) You’ll then be given the option for the skill/plugin folder to place the function. Always group functions that are similar together. After creating a skill, enter the name

<!-- Page 136 -->

**112** CHAPTER 5 ***Empowering agents with actions***

and description of the function you want to develop. Be sure to describe the function as if the LLM were going to use it.

**1. Select the icon to create a new semantic skill/plugin.**
**2. Select an existing skill folder, or create a new one.**
**3. Name the function.**
**4. Then, provide a description.**
Figure 5.6 The process of creating a new skill/plugin

You can see the completed skills and functions by opening the skills/plugin folder and reviewing the files. We’ll follow the previously constructed example, so open the skills/Recommender/Recommend_Movies folder, as shown in figure 5.7. Inside this folder is a config.json file, the function description, and the semantic function/prompt in a file called skprompt.txt. Listing 5.11 shows the contents of the semantic function definition, also known as the plugin definition. Note that the type is marked as completion and not of type function because this is a semantic function. We would define a native function as a type function.

Listing 5.11 **Recommend_Movies/config.json**

{ **Semantic functions are** "schema": 1, **functions of type completion.** "type": "completion", "description": "A function to recommend movies based on users list of previously seen movies.", "completion": { **We can also set the** "max_tokens": 256, **completion parameters for** "temperature": 0, **how the function is called.** "top_p": 0, "presence_penalty": 0, "frequency_penalty": 0 }, "input": { **Defines the parameters** "parameters": [ **input into the semantic** { **function** "name": "input", "description": "The users list of previously seen movies.", "defaultValue": "" }] }, "default_backends": [] }

Next, we can look at the definition of the semantic function prompt, as shown in list- ing 5.12. The format is a little different, but what we see here matches the earlier examples using templating. This prompt recommends movies based on a list of mov- ies the user has previously seen.

Listing 5.12 **Recommend_Movies/skprompt.txt**

You are a wise movie recommender and you have been asked to recommend a movie to a user. You are provided a list of movies that the user has watched before. You want to recommend a movie that the user has not watched before. [INPUT]

{{$input}} [END INPUT]

Now, we’ll dive into the code that loads the skill/plugin and executes it in a simple example. Open the SK_first_skill.py file in VS Code. The following listing shows an abridged version highlighting the new sections.

Listing 5.13 SK_first_skill.py (abridged listing)

kernel = sk.Kernel()

plugins_directory = "plugins"

recommender = kernel.import_plugin_from_prompt_directory( plugins_directory, "Recommender", **Loads the prompt from** ) **the plugins folder**

recommend = recommender["Recommend_Movies"] **List of user’s previously** seen_movie_list = [ **seen movies** "Back to the Future", "The Terminator", "12 Monkeys", "Looper", "Groundhog Day", "Primer", "Donnie Darko", "Interstellar", "Time Bandits", "Doctor Strange",]

async def run(): result = await kernel.invoke( **Input is set to joined** recommend, **list of seen movies.** sk.KernelArguments( settings=execution_settings, input=", ".join(seen_movie_list) ), ) print(result)

**Function is executed** asyncio.run(run()) **asynchronously.**

###Output Based on the list of movies you've provided, it seems you have an interest in science fiction, time travel, and mind-bending narratives. Given that you've watched a mix of classics and modern films in this genre, I would recommend the following movie that you have not watched before:

"Edge of Tomorrow" (also known as "Live Die Repeat: Edge of Tomorrow")…

<!-- Page 139 -->

***5.4 Synergizing semantic and native functions* 115**
The code loads the skill/plugin from the skills directory and the plugin folder. When a skill is loaded into the kernel and not just created, it becomes a registered plugin. That means it can be executed directly as is done here or through an LLM chat conversation via the plugin interface. Run the code (F5), and you should see an output like listing 5.13. We now have a simple semantic function that can be hosted as a plugin. However, this function requires users to input a complete list of movies they have watched. We’ll look at a means to fix this by introducing native functions in the next section.

# 5.4.2 Applying native functions

As stated, native functions are code that can do anything. In the following example, we’ll introduce a native function to assist the semantic function we built earlier. This native function will load a list of movies the user has previously seen, from a file. While this function introduces the concept of memory, we’ll defer that discussion until chapter 8. Consider this new native function as any code that could virtually do anything. Native functions can be created and registered using the SK extension. For this exam- ple, we’ll create a native function directly in code to make the example easier to follow. Open SK_native_functions.py in VS Code. We’ll start by looking at how the native function is defined. A native function is typically defined within a class, which simplifies managing and instantiating native functions.

Listing 5.14 **SK_native_functions.py** (**MySeenMovieDatabase**)

**Provides a description** class MySeenMoviesDatabase: **for the container class Uses a decorator to** """ **provide function** Description: Manages the list of users seen movies. **description and** """ **name** @kernel_function( description="Loads a list of movies … user has already seen", name="LoadSeenMovies", ) **The actual function** def load_seen_movies(self) -> str: **returns a list of movies in a** try: **comma-separated string.** with open("seen_movies.txt", 'r') as file: lines = [line.strip() for line in file.readlines()] comma_separated_string = ', '.join(lines) return comma_separated_string **Loads seen** except Exception as e: **movies from** print(f"Error reading file: {e}") **the text file** return None

With the native function defined, we can see how it’s used by scrolling down in the file, as shown in the following listing.

<!-- Page 140 -->

**116** CHAPTER 5 ***Empowering agents with actions***

Listing 5.15 **SK_native_functions** (remaining code)

plugins_directory = "plugins"

recommender = kernel.import_plugin_from_prompt_directory( plugins_directory, "Recommender", **Loads the semantic function** ) **as shown previously**

recommend = recommender["Recommend_Movies"] **Imports the skill into the kernel and** seen_movies_plugin = kernel.import_plugin_from_object( **registers the function** MySeenMoviesDatabase(), "SeenMoviesPlugin" **as a plugin** )

load_seen_movies = seen_movies_plugin["LoadSeenMovies"] **Loads the native function**

async def show_seen_movies(): seen_movie_list = await load_seen_movies(kernel) return seen_movie_list **Executes the** **function and returns the list as a string** seen_movie_list = asyncio.run(show_seen_movies()) print(seen_movie_list)

async def run(): result = await kernel.invoke( recommend, sk.KernelArguments( **Wraps the** settings=execution_settings, **plugin call in an** input=seen_movie_list), **asynchronous** **function and** ) **executes** print(result)

asyncio.run(run())

###Output The Matrix, The Matrix Reloaded, The Matrix Revolutions, The Matrix Resurrections – *output from print statement* Based on your interest in the "The Matrix" series, it seems you enjoy science fiction films with a strong philosophical undertone and action elements. Given that you've watched all

One important aspect to note is how the native function was imported into the kernel. The act of importing to the kernel registers that function as a plugin/skill. This means the function can be used as a skill from the kernel through other conversations or interactions. We’ll see how to embed a native function within a semantic function in the next section.

<!-- Page 141 -->

***5.4 Synergizing semantic and native functions* 117**
# 5.4.3 Embedding native functions within semantic functions

There are plenty of powerful features within SK, but one beneficial feature is the abil- ity to embed native or semantic functions within other semantic functions. The follow- ing listing shows how a native function can be embedded within a semantic function.

Listing 5.16 **SK_semantic_native_functions.py** (**skprompt**)

sk_prompt = """ You are a wise movie recommender and you have been asked to recommend a movie to a user. You have a list of movies that the user has watched before. **The exact** You want to recommend a movie that **instruction text** the user has not watched before. **as previous** Movie List: {{MySeenMoviesDatabase.LoadSeenMovies}}. """ **The native function is referenced and identified by class name and function name.**

The next example, SK_semantic_native_functions.py, uses inline native and seman- tic functions. Open the file in VS Code, and the following listing shows the code to create, register, and execute the functions.

Listing 5.17 **SK_semantic_native_functions.py** (abridged)

prompt_template_config = sk.PromptTemplateConfig( template=sk_prompt, name="tldr", template_format="semantic-kernel", execution_settings=execution_settings, **Creates the prompt template** ) **config for the prompt**

recommend_function = kernel.create_function_from_prompt( prompt_template_config=prompt_template_config, function_name="Recommend_Movies", plugin_name="Recommendation", **Creates an inline semantic** ) **function from the prompt**

async def run_recommendation(): **Executes the semantic** recommendation = await kernel.invoke( **function asynchronously** recommend_function, sk.KernelArguments(), ) print(recommendation)

# Use asyncio.run to execute the async function asyncio.run(run_recommendation()) ###Output Based on the list provided, it seems the user is a fan of the Matrix franchise. Since they have watched all four existing Matrix movies, I would recommend a…

<!-- Page 142 -->

**118** CHAPTER 5 ***Empowering agents with actions***

Run the code, and you should see an output like listing 5.17. One important aspect to note is that the native function is registered with the kernel, but the semantic function is not. This is important because function creation doesn’t register a function. For this example to work correctly, the native function must be registered with the kernel, which uses the import_plugin function call—the first line in listing 5.17. How- ever, the semantic function itself isn’t registered. An easy way to register the function is to make it a plugin and import it. These simple exercises showcase ways to integrate plugins and skills into chat or agent interfaces. In the next section, we’ll look at a complete example demonstrating adding a plugin representing a service or GPT interface to a chat function.

# 5.5 Semantic Kernel as an interactive service agent

In chapter 1, we introduced the concept of the GPT interface—a new paradigm in connecting services and other components to LLMs via plugins and semantic layers. SK provides an excellent abstraction for converting any service to a GPT interface.

Figure 5.8 shows a GPT interface constructed around an API service called The

Movie Database (TMDB; www.themoviedb.org). The TMDB site provides a free API that exposes information about movies and TV shows.

**A user can access the site now in three ways: web, chat, or agent.**

Figure 5.8 This layer architecture diagram shows the role of a GPT interface and the Semantic

Kernel being exposed to chat or agent interfaces.

To follow along with the exercises in this section, you must register for a free account from TMDB and create an API key. Instructions for getting an API key can be found at the TMDB website (www.themoviedb.org) or by asking a GPT-4 turbo or a more recent LLM.

<!-- Page 143 -->

***5.5 Semantic Kernel as an interactive service agent* 119**
Over the next set of subsections, we’ll create a GPT interface using an SK set of native functions. Then, we’ll use the SK kernel to test the interface and, later in this chapter, implement it as plugins into a chat function. In the next section, we look at building a GPT interface against the TMDB API.

# 5.5.1 Building a semantic GPT interface

TMDB is an excellent service, but it provides no semantic services or services that can be plugged into ChatGPT or an agent. To do that, we must wrap the API calls that TMDB exposes in a semantic service layer. A semantic service layer is a GPT interface that exposes functions through natural language. As discussed, to expose functions to ChatGPT or other interfaces such as agents, they must be defined as plugins. Fortunately, SK can create the plugins for us automatically, given that we write our semantic service layer correctly. A native plugin or set of skills can act as a semantic layer. To create a native plugin, create a new plugin folder, and put a Python file holding a class containing the set of native functions inside that folder. The SK extension currently doesn’t do this well, so manually creating the module works best.

Figure 5.9 shows the structure of the new plugin called Movies and the semantic

service layer called tmdb.py. For native functions, the parent folder’s name (Movies) is used in the import.

**Parent skills folder**

**Name of the plugin folder**

**File/module containing the class** Figure 5.9 The folder and file **and set of native functions** structure of the TMDB plugin

Open the tmdb.py file in VS Code, and look at the top of the file, as shown in listing

5.18. This file contains a class called TMDbService, which exposes several functions that map to API endpoint calls. The idea is to map the various relevant API function calls in this semantic service layer. This will expose the functions as plugins for a chat or agent interface. Listing 5.18 **tmdb.py** (top of file) from semantic_kernel.functions import kernel_funct import requests import inspect
**Prints the calls to the functions for**

def print_function_call(): **debugging** #omitted …

<!-- Page 144 -->

**120** CHAPTER 5 ***Empowering agents with actions***

class TMDbService: def __init__(self): **Top-level service and decorator** # enter your TMDb API key here **used to describe** self.api_key = "your-TMDb-api-key" **the function (good descriptions are**

**important)** @kernel_function( description="Gets the movie genre ID for a given genre name", name="get_movie_genre_id", input_description="The movie genre name of the genre_id to get", ) def get_movie_genre_id(self, genre_name: str) -> str: **Function wrapped in** print_function_call() **semantic wrapper;** base_url = "[https://api.themoviedb.org/3"](https://api.themoviedb.org/3") **should return str** endpoint = f"{base_url}/genre/movie/list ➥?api_key={self.api_key}&language=en-US"

response = requests.get(endpoint) **Calls the API endpoint, and,** if response.status_code == 200: **if good (code 200), checks** genres = response.json()['genres'] **for matching genre** for genre in genres: if genre_name.lower() in genre['name'].lower(): return str(genre['id']) return None **Found the genre,**

## returns the id

The bulk of the code for the TMDbService and the functions to call the TMDB end- points was written with the help of GPT-4 Turbo. Then, each function was wrapped with the sk_function decorator to expose it semantically. A few of the TMDB API calls have been mapped semantically. Listing 5.19 shows another example of a function exposed to the semantic service layer. This function pulls a current top 10 list of movies playing for a particular genre.

Listing 5.19 **tmdb.py** (**get_top_movies_by_genre**)

@kernel_function( **Decorates the function** description="”” **with descriptions** Gets a list of currently playing movies for a given genre””", name="get_top_movies_by_genre", input_description="The genre of the movies to get", ) def get_top_movies_by_genre(self, genre: str) -> str: **Finds the genre** print_function_call() **id for the given** genre_id = self.get_movie_genre_id(genre) **genre name** if genre_id: base_url = "[https://api.themoviedb.org/3](https://api.themoviedb.org/3) playing_movies_endpoint = f"{base_url}/movie/now_playing? ➥ api_key={self.api_key}&language=en-US" response = requests.get( playing_movies_endpoint)

Look through the various other API calls mapped semantically. As you can see, there is a well-defined pattern for converting API calls to a semantic service. Before we run the full service, we’ll test each of the functions in the next section.

# 5.5.2 Testing semantic services

In a real-world application, you’ll likely want to write a complete set of unit or integra- tion tests for each semantic service function. We won’t do that here; instead, we’ll write a quick helper script to test the various functions. Open test_tmdb_service.py in VS Code, and review the code, as shown in listing

5.20. You can comment and uncomment any functions to test them in isolation. Be sure to have only one function uncommented at a time. Listing 5.20 **test_tmdb_service.py** import semantic_kernel as sk from plugins.Movies.tmdb import TMDbService async def main(): kernel = sk.Kernel() tmdb_service = kernel.import_plugin_from_object ➥ (TMDbService(), "TMDBService") print( await tmdb_service["get_movie_genre_id"]( kernel, sk.KernelArguments( genre_name="action") ) ) print( await tmdb_service["get_tv_show_genre_id"]( kernel, sk.KernelArguments( genre_name="action") ) ) print( await tmdb_service["get_top_movies_by_genre"]( kernel, sk.KernelArguments(

<!-- Page 146 -->

**122** CHAPTER 5 ***Empowering agents with actions***

genre_name="action") ) ) **Executes and tests the various functions Inputs parameter** print( **to functions,** await tmdb_service["get_top_tv_shows_by_genre"]( **when needed** kernel, sk.KernelArguments( genre_name="action") ) ) print(await tmdb_service["get_movie_genres"]( kernel, sk.KernelArguments())) **Executes and tests** print(await tmdb_service["get_tv_show_genres"]( **the various functions** kernel, sk.KernelArguments()))

# Run the main function if __name__ == "__main__": import asyncio **Calls print** **Executes main function details asynchronously to notify when** asyncio.run(main()) **the function is being called**

###Output Function name: get_top_tv_shows_by_genre Arguments: self = <skills.Movies.tmdb.TMDbService object at 0x00000159F52090C0> genre = action Function name: get_tv_show_genre_id Arguments: self = <skills.Movies.tmdb.TMDbService object at 0x00000159F52090C0> genre_name = action Arcane, One Piece, Rick and Morty, Avatar: The Last Airbender, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba, Invincible, Attack on Titan, My Hero Academia, Fighting Spirit, The Owl House

The real power of SK is shown in this test. Notice how the TMDbService class is imported as a plugin, but we don’t have to define any plugin configurations other than what we already did? By just writing one class that wrapped a few API functions, we’ve exposed part of the TMDB API semantically. Now, with the functions exposed, we can look at how they can be used as plugins for a chat interface in the next section.

# 5.5.3 Interactive chat with the semantic service layer

With the TMDB functions exposed semantically, we can move on to integrating them into a chat interface. This will allow us to converse naturally in this interface to get var- ious information, such as current top movies. Open SK_service_chat.py in VS Code. Scroll down to the start of the new section of code that creates the functions, as shown in listing 5.21. The functions created here are now exposed as plugins, except we filter out the chat function, which we don’t want to expose as a plugin. The chat function here allows the user to converse directly with the LLM and shouldn’t be a plugin.

<!-- Page 147 -->

***5.5 Semantic Kernel as an interactive service agent* 123**
Listing 5.21 **SK_service_chat.py** (function setup)

system_message = "You are a helpful AI assistant." **Imports the** **TMDbService** tmdb_service = kernel.import_plugin_from_object( **as a plugin** TMDbService(), "TMDBService")

# extracted section of code execution_settings = sk_oai.OpenAIChatPromptExecutionSettings( service_id=service_id, ai_model_id=model_id, max_tokens=2000, temperature=0.7, top_p=0.8, tool_choice="auto", **Configures the** **execution settings and** tools=get_tool_call_object( **adds filtered tools** kernel, {"exclude_plugin": ["ChatBot"]}), )

prompt_config = sk.PromptTemplateConfig.from_completion_parameters( max_tokens=2000, temperature=0.7, top_p=0.8, function_call="auto", **Configures** **the prompt** chat_system_prompt=system_message, **configuration** ) prompt_template = OpenAIChatPromptTemplate( "{{$user_input}}", kernel.prompt_template_engine, prompt_config ) **Defines the input template and takes full** history = ChatHistory() **strings as user input**

history.add_system_message("You recommend movies and TV Shows.") history.add_user_message("Hi there, who are you?") history.add_assistant_message( "I am Rudy, the recommender chat bot. I'm trying to figure out what people need." **Adds the chat history object** ) **and populates some history** chat_function = kernel.create_function_from_prompt( prompt_template_config=prompt_template, plugin_name="ChatBot", function_name="Chat", ) **Creates the chat function**

Next, we can continue by scrolling in the same file to review the chat function, as shown in the following listing.

Listing 5.22 **SK_service_chat.py** (chat function)

async def chat() -> bool: try: **Input is taken** user_input = input("User:> ") **directly from the** except KeyboardInterrupt: **terminal/console.**

<!-- Page 148 -->

**124** CHAPTER 5 ***Empowering agents with actions***

print("\n\nExiting chat...") return False except EOFError: print("\n\nExiting chat...") return False **If the user types** **exit, then exit the chat.** if user_input == "exit": print("\n\nExiting chat...") **Creates arguments to** return False **pass to the function** arguments = sk.KernelArguments( user_input=user_input, history=("\n").join( [f"{msg.role}: {msg.content}" for msg in history]), ) result = await chat_completion_with_tool_call( **Uses the utility** kernel=kernel, **function to call** arguments=arguments, **the function and** chat_plugin_name="ChatBot", **execute the tool** chat_function_name="Chat", chat_history=history, ) print(f"AI Agent:> {result}") return True

Lastly, scroll down to the bottom of the file, and review the primary function. This is the code that calls the chat function in a loop.

Listing 5.23 **SK_service_chat.py** (main function)

async def main() -> None: chatting = True context = kernel.create_new_context() **Introduction to the user** print("Welcome to your first AI Agent\ \n Type 'exit' to exit.\ \n Ask to get a list of currently playing movies by genre." **Continues until** ) **chatting is False** while chatting: chatting, context = await chat(context) **Calls the chat function**

**asynchronously** if __name__ == "__main__": asyncio.ru n(main())

Run the chat interface, run the file (F5), and then ask about movies or television shows of a particular genre. An example conversation session is shown in listing 5.24. This output shows how a request to list movies from two genres made the chat inter- face make multiple calls to the get_top_movie_by_genre function.

Listing 5.24 **SK_service_chat.py** (example conversation)

Welcome to your first AI Agent Type 'exit' to exit.

8. Migration Please note that some movies may overlap in both genres, such as "The Family Plan" and "Freelance." Be sure to explore the chat interface’s boundaries and what you can ask for from the TMDB service. For example, try asking for a list of genres for movies or television shows. This service is a good first try, but we can perhaps do better, as we’ll see in the next section.
# 5.6 Thinking semantically when writing semantic services

Now we’ve seen an excellent demonstration of converting an API into a semantic ser- vice interface. As it is, the functions return the titles of the top movies and television shows currently playing. However, by just returning the titles, we’re limiting the ability of the LLM to parse the results on its own.

<!-- Page 150 -->

**126** CHAPTER 5 ***Empowering agents with actions***

Therefore, we’ll create a v2 version of TMDbService to correct this and return the results as JSON strings. Open the file tmdb_v2.py in VS Code, and scroll down to the get_top_movies_by_genre function.

Listing 5.25 **tmdb_v2.py** (**get_top_movies_by_genre**)

def get_top_movies_by_genre(self, genre: str) -> str: print_function_call() genre_id = self.get_movie_genre_id(genre) if genre_id: #same code … **Now returns a** **filtered list as** return json.dumps(filtered_movies) **a JSON string** else: return ""

Now open SK_service_chat.py in VS Code, and comment and uncomment the line shown in listing 5.26. This will then use version 2 of the TMDbService that outputs results as full JSON documents in a single string.

Listing 5.26 **SK_service_chat.py** (modifying imports)

#from skills.Movies.tmdb import TMDbService **Comment out this line.** from skills.Movies.tmdb_v2 import TMDbService **Uncomment this line to use version 2 of the service.**

Rerun the SK_service_chat.py file in VS Code, and alter your query slightly, as shown by the output in the following listing.

Listing 5.27 **SK_service_chat.py** (**TMDb_v2** service output) **New query asks to include an additional** User:> get a list of currently playing movies for the **filter for space** action genre and only return movies about space Agent:> To find currently playing action movies that are specifically about space, I will need to manually filter the provided list for those that have space-related themes in their overview. Here's what fits that criteria from the list:

1. **Rebel Moon-Part One: A Child of Fire**
- Release Date: 2023-12-15
- Overview: When a peaceful colony on the edge of the galaxy finds itself threatened by the armies of the tyrannical Regent Balisarius, they dispatch Kora, a young woman with a mysterious past, to seek out warriors from neighboring planets to help them take a stand. This is the only movie from the provided list that clearly mentions a space-related theme in its overview. …
**The LLM calls the service and then reviews the returned results that**

**match the filter.**

<!-- Page 151 -->

***5.7 Exercises* 127**
Because the semantic service functions now return the complete movie listing in JSON, the LLM can apply additional filtering. This is the real power of semantic services, allowing you to process the data through the LLM. We won’t see this power by just returning a list of titles. This last exercise demonstrated the change in mentality you need to make when writing semantic service layers. Generally, you’ll typically want to return as much infor- mation as possible. Returning more information takes advantage of the LLM abilities to filter, sort, and transform data independently. In the next chapter, we’ll explore building autonomous agents using behavior trees.

# Summary

- Agent actions extend the capabilities of an agent system, such as ChatGPT. This includes the ability to add plugins to ChatGPT and LLMs to function as proxies for actions.
- OpenAI supports function definitions and plugins within an OpenAI API ses- sion. This includes adding function definitions to LLM API calls and under- standing how these functions allow the LLM to perform additional actions.
- The Semantic Kernel (SK) is an open source project from Microsoft that can be used to build AI applications and agent systems. This includes the role of seman- tic plugins in defining native and semantic functions.
- Semantic functions encapsulate the prompt/profile template used to engage an LLM.
- Native functions encapsulate code that performs or executes an action using an API or other interface.
- Semantic functions can be combined with other semantic or native functions and layered within one another as execution stages.
- SK can be used to create a GPT interface over the top of API calls in a semantic service layer and expose them as chat or agent interface plugins.
- Semantic services represent the interaction between LLMs and plugins, as well as the practical implementation of these concepts in creating efficient AI agents.

- Autonomous control of agentic behavior trees
- Simulating conversational multi-agent systems via agentic behavior trees
- Using back chaining to create behavior trees for complex systems
Now that we’ve covered how actions extend the power/capabilities of agents, we can look at how behavior trees can guide agentic systems. We’ll start by understand- ing the basics of behavior trees and how they control robotics and AI in games. We’ll return to agentic actions and examine how actions can be implemented on the OpenAI Assistants platform using the GPT Assistants Playground project. From there, we’ll look at how to build an autonomous agentic behavior tree (ABT) using OpenAI assistants. Then, we’ll move on to understanding the need for con- trols and guardrails on autonomous agents and using control barrier functions.

**130** CHAPTER 6 ***Building autonomous assistants***

In the final section of the chapter, we’ll examine the use of the AgentOps platform to monitor our autonomous behavior-driven agentic systems. This will be an exciting chapter with several challenges. Let’s begin by jumping into the next section, which introduces behavior trees.

## 6.1 Introducing behavior trees

Behavior trees are a long-established pattern used to control robotics and AI in games. Rodney A. Brooks first introduced the concept in his “A Robust Layered Control Sys- tem for a Mobile Robot” paper in 1986. This laid the groundwork for a pattern that expanded on using the tree and node structure we have today. If you’ve ever played a computer game with nonplayer characters (NPCs) or inter- acted with advanced robotic systems, you’ve witnessed behavior trees at work. Figure 6.1 shows a simple behavior tree. The tree represents all the primary nodes: selector or fallback nodes, sequence nodes, action nodes, and condition nodes.

Table 6.1 describes the functions and purpose of the primary nodes we’ll explore in

this book. There are other nodes and node types, and you can even create custom nodes, but for now, we’ll focus on those in the table.

The primary nodes in table 6.1 can provide enough functionality to handle numerous use cases. However, understanding behavior trees initially can be daunting. You won’t appreciate their underlying complexity until you start using them. Before we build some simple trees, we want to look at execution in more detail in the next section.

# 6.1.1 Understanding behavior tree execution

Understanding how behavior trees execute is crucial to designing and implementing behavior trees. Unlike most concepts in computer science, behavior trees operate in terms of success and failure. When a node in a behavior tree executes, it will return either success or failure; this even applies to conditions and selector nodes. Behavior trees execute from top to bottom and left to right. Figure 6.2 shows the process and what happens if a node fails or succeeds. In the example, the AI the tree controls has an apple but no pear. In the first sequence node, a condition checks if the AI has an apple. Because the AI doesn’t have an apple, it aborts the sequence and falls back to the selector. The selector then selects its next child node, another sequence, that checks if the AI has a pear, and because it does, the AI eats the apple.

Figure 6.2 The execution process of a simple behavior tree

Behavior trees provide control over how an AI system will execute at a macro or micro level. Regarding robotics, behavior trees will typically be designed to operate at the micro level, where each action or condition is a small event, such as detecting the apple. Conversely, behavior trees can also control more macro systems, such as NPCs in games, where each action may be a combination of events, like attacking the player. For agentic systems, behavior trees support controlling an agent or assistant at your chosen level. We’ll explore controlling agents at the task and, in later chapters, the planning levels. After all, with the power of LLMs, agents can construct their own behavior tree. Of course, several other forms of AI control could be used to control agentic sys- tems. The next section will examine those different systems and compare them to behavior trees.

## 6.1.2 Deciding on behavior trees

Numerous other AI control systems have benefits and are worth exploring in con- trolling agentic systems. They can demonstrate the benefits of behavior trees and pro- vide other options for specific use cases. The behavior tree is an excellent pattern, but it isn’t the only one, and it’s worth learning about others.

Table 6.2 highlights several other systems we may consider for controlling AI sys-

tems. Each item in the table describes what the method does, its shortcomings, and its possible application to agentic AI control.

Control agentic AI?

FSMs aren’t practical for agents because they don’t scale well.

Decision trees can be adapted and enhanced with behavior trees.

This pattern can be adopted within a behavior tree.

These aren’t very practical when paired with agentic systems powered by LLMs.

Agents can already imple- ment such patterns on their own as we’ll see in later chapters.

This can be incorporated into behavior trees or into a specific task.

HTNs allow for better orga- nization and execution of complex tasks. This pat- tern can be used for larger agentic systems.

Agentic systems can implement similar pat- terns using conversation or group chats/threads.

GAs have potential and could even be used to optimize behavior trees.

<!-- Page 158 -->

**134** CHAPTER 6 ***Building autonomous assistants***

In later chapters of this book, we’ll investigate some of the patterns discussed in

table 6.2. Overall, several patterns can be enhanced or incorporated using behavior

trees as the base. While other patterns, such as FSMs, may be helpful for small experi- ments, they lack the scalability of behavior trees. Behavior trees can provide several benefits as an AI control system, including scal- ability. The following list highlights other notable benefits of using behavior trees:

- *Modularity and reusability*—Behavior trees promote a modular approach to design- ing behaviors, allowing developers to create reusable components. Nodes in a behavior tree can be easily reused across different parts of the tree or even in different projects, enhancing maintainability and reducing development time.
- *Scalability*—As systems grow in complexity, behavior trees handle the addition of new behaviors more gracefully than other methods, such as FSMs. Behavior trees allow for the hierarchical organization of tasks, making it easier to manage and understand large behavior sets.
- *Flexibility and extensibility*—Behavior trees offer a flexible framework where new nodes (actions, conditions, decorators) can be added without drastically alter- ing the existing structure. This extensibility makes it straightforward to intro- duce new behaviors or modify existing ones to adapt to new requirements.
- *Debugging and visualization*—Behavior trees provide a clear and intuitive visual representation of behaviors, which is beneficial for debugging and understand- ing the decision-making process. Tools that support behavior trees often include graphical editors that allow developers to visualize and debug the tree structure, making it easier to identify and fix problems.
- *Decoupling of decision logic*—Behavior trees separate the decision-making and execution logic, promoting a clear distinction between high-level strategy and low-level actions. This decoupling simplifies the design and allows for more straightforward modifications and testing of specific behavior parts without affecting the entire system.
Having made a strong case for behavior trees, we should now consider how to imple- ment them in code. In the next section, we look at how to build a simple behavior tree, using Python code.

# 6.1.3 Running behavior trees with Python and py_trees

Because behavior trees have been around for so long and have been incorporated into many technologies, creating a sample demonstration is very simple. Of course, the easi- est way is to ask ChatGPT or your favorite AI chat tool. Listing 6.1 shows the result of using a prompt to generate the code sample and submitting figure 6.1 as the example tree. The final code had to be corrected for simple naming and parameter errors.

NOTE All the code for this chapter can be found by downloading the GPT Assistants Playground project at [https://mng.bz/Ea0q](https://mng.bz/Ea0q).

<!-- Page 159 -->

The code in listing 6.1 represents the behavior tree in figure 6.1. You can run this code as is or alter what the conditions return and then run the tree again. You can also change the behavior tree by removing one of the sequence nodes from the root selector. Now that we have a basic understanding of behavior trees, we can move on to working with agents/assistants. Before doing that, we’ll look at a tool to help us work

<!-- Page 160 -->

**136** CHAPTER 6 ***Building autonomous assistants***

with OpenAI Assistants. This tool will help us wrap our first ABTs around OpenAI Assistants.

# 6.2 Exploring the GPT Assistants Playground

For the development of this book, several GitHub projects were created to address var- ious aspects of building agents and assistants. One such project, the GPT Assistants Playground, is built using Gradio for the interface that mimics the OpenAI Assistants Playground but with several extras added. The Playground project was developed as both a teaching and demonstration aid. Inside the project, the Python code uses the OpenAI Assistants API to create a chat inter- face and an agentic system to build and power assistants. There is also a comprehensive collection of actions assistants you can use, and you can easily add your own actions.

## 6.2.1 Installing and running the Playground

The following listing shows installing and running the Playground project from the terminal. There is currently no PyPI package to install.

Listing 6.2 Installing the GPT Assistants Playground

**Installs the Changes directory to the requirements project source code folder**

You can run the application from the terminal or using Visual Studio Code (VS Code), with the latter giving you more control. Before running the application, you need to set your OpenAI API key through the command line or by creating an .env file, as we’ve done a few times already. Listing 6.3 shows an example of setting the environment variable on Linux/Mac or the Git Bash shell (Windows recommended) and running the application.

Listing 6.3 Running the GPT Assistants Playground

**Sets your API key as an** export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key" **environment variable** python main.py **Runs the app from the terminal or via VS Code**

Open your browser to the URL displayed (typically [http://127.0.0.1:7860](http://127.0.0.1:7860)) or what is mentioned in the terminal. You’ll see an interface similar to that shown in figure 6.3.

If you’ve never defined an assistant, you can create one and choose the various options and instructions you need. If you’ve visited the OpenAI Playground, you’ve already experienced a similar interface.

GPT vs. an assistant OpenAI defines a GPT as the assistant you can run and use within the ChatGPT inter- face. An assistant can only be consumed through the API and requires custom code in most cases. When you run an assistant, you’re charged according to the model token usage and any special tools, including the Code Interpreter and files, whereas a GPT runs within ChatGPT and is covered by account costs.

<!-- Page 162 -->

**138** CHAPTER 6 ***Building autonomous assistants***

***(continued)*** The reason for creating a local version of the Playground was an exercise to demon- strate the code structure but also provide additional features listed here:

- *Actions (custom actions)*—Creating your own actions allows you to add any functionality you want to an assistant. As we’ll see, the Playground makes it very easy to create your own actions quickly.
- *Code runner*—The API does come with a Code Interpreter, but it’s relatively expensive ($.03 per run), doesn’t allow you to install your modules, can’t run code interactively, and runs slowly. The Playground will enable you to run Python code locally in an isolated virtual environment. While not as secure as pushing code out to Docker images, it does execute code windowed and out of process better than other platforms.
- *Transparency and logging*—The Playground provides for comprehensive cap- turing of logs and will even show how the assistant uses internal and external tools/actions. This can be an excellent way to see what the assistant is doing behind the scenes.
Each of these features is covered in more detail over the next few sections. We’ll start with a look at using and consuming actions in the next section.

# 6.2.2 Using and building custom actions

Actions and tools are the building blocks that empower agents and assistants. Without access to tools, agents are functionless chatbots. The OpenAI platform is a leader in establishing many of the patterns for tools, as we saw in chapter 3. The Playground provides several custom actions that can be attached to assistants through the interface. In this next exercise, we’ll build a simple assistant and attach a couple of custom actions to see what is possible.

Figure 6.4 shows the expanded Actions accordion, which displays many available

custom actions. Run the Playground from the terminal or debugger, and create a new assistant. Then, select the actions shown in the figure. After you’re done selecting the actions, scroll to the bottom, and click Add Assistant to add the assistant. Assistants need to be created before they can be used. After you create the assistant, you can ask it to list all available assistants. Listing the assistants also gives you the IDs required to call the assistant. You can also call other assistants and ask them to complete tasks in their area of specialization. Adding your custom actions is as simple as adding code to a file and dropping it in the right folder. Open the playground/assistant_actions folder from the main project folder, and you’ll see several files that define the various actions. Open the file_actions.py file in VS Code, as shown in listing 6.4.

<!-- Page 164 -->

**140** CHAPTER 6 ***Building autonomous assistants***

You can add any custom action you want by placing the file in the assistant_actions folder and decorating it with the agent_action decorator. Just make sure to give the function a good name and enter quality documentation for how the function should be used. When the Playground starts up, it loads all the actions in the folder that are decorated correctly and have descriptions/documentation. It’s that simple. You can add several custom actions as needed. In the next section, we’ll look at a special custom action that allows the assistant to run code locally.

# 6.2.3 Installing the assistants database

To run several of the examples in this chapter, you’ll need to install the assistants data- base. Fortunately, this can be easily done through the interface and just by asking agents. The upcoming instructions detail the process for installing the assistants and are taken directly from the GPT Assistants Playground README. You can install sev- eral of the demo assistants located in the assistants.db SQLite database:

1 Create a new assistant, or use an existing assistant. 2 Give the assistant the create_manager_assistant action (found under the Actions section). 3 Ask the assistant to create the manager assistant (i.e., “please create the man- ager assistant”), and be sure to name the assistant “Manager Assistant.” 4 Refresh your browser to reload the assistants selector. 5 Select the new Manager Assistant. This assistant has the instructions and actions that will allow it to install assistants from the assistants.db database. 6 Talk to the Manager Assistant to give you a list of assistants to install, or just ask the Manager Assistant to install all available assistants.

# 6.2.4 Getting an assistant to run code locally

Getting agents and assistants to generate and run executable code has a lot of power. Unlike the Code Interpreter, running code locally provides numerous opportunities to iterate and tune quickly. We saw this earlier with AutoGen, where the agents could keep running the code until it worked as expected. In the Playground, it’s a simple matter to select the custom action run_code, as shown in figure 6.5. You’ll also want to choose the run_shell_command action because it allows the assistant to pip install any required modules.

<!-- Page 165 -->

***6.2 Exploring the GPT Assistants Playground* 141**
**Do not select the** **Code Interpreter tool.**

**Select both the run_code and run_shell_command custom**

**actions. Running commands on the shell allows an assistant to**

**install new packages as required.**

Figure 6.5 Selecting custom actions for the assistant to run Python code

You can now ask an assistant to generate and run the code to be sure it works on your behalf. Try this out by adding the custom actions and asking the assistant to generate and run code, as shown in figure 6.6. If the code doesn’t work as expected, tell the assistant what problems you encountered. Again, the Python code running in the Playground creates a new virtual environ- ment in a project subfolder. This system works well if you’re not running any operat- ing system–level code or low-level code. If you need something more robust, a good option is AutoGen, which uses Docker containers to run isolated code. Adding actions to run code or other tasks can make assistants feel like a black box. Fortunately, the OpenAI Assistants API allows you to consume events and see what the assistant is doing behind the scenes. In the next section, we’ll see what this looks like.

<!-- Page 166 -->

Figure 6.6 Getting the assistant to generate and run Python code

# 6.2.5 Investigating the assistant process through logs

OpenAI added a feature into the Assistants API that allows you to listen to events and actions chained through tool/action use. This feature has been integrated into the Playground, capturing action and tool use when an assistant calls another assistant. We can try this by asking an assistant to use a tool and then open the log. A great example of how you can do this is by giving an assistant the Code Interpreter tool and then asking it to plot an equation. Figure 6.7 shows an example of this exercise. Usually, when the Assistant Code Interpreter tool is enabled, you don’t see any code generation or execution. This feature allows you to see all tools and actions used by the assistant as they happen. Not only is it an excellent tool for diagnostics, but it also provides additional insights into the functions of LLMs. We haven’t reviewed the code to do all this because it’s extensive and will likely undergo several changes. That being said, if you plan on working with the Assistants API, this project is a good place to start. With the Playground introduced, we can con- tinue our journey into ABTs in the next section.

# 6.3 Introducing agentic behavior trees

Agentic behavior trees (ABTs) implement behavior trees on assistant and agent sys- tems. The key difference between regular behavior trees and ABTs is that they use prompts to direct actions and conditions. Because prompts may return a high occur- rence of random results, we could also name these trees *stochastic* behavior trees, which do exist. For simplicity, we’ll differentiate behavior trees used to control agents, referring to them as agentic. Next, we’ll undertake an exercise to create an ABT. The finished tree will be writ- ten in Python but will require the setup and configuration of various assistants. We’ll cover how to manage assistants using the assistants themselves.

## 6.3.1 Managing assistants with assistants

Fortunately, the Playground can help us quickly manage and create the assistants. We’ll first install the Manager Assistant, followed by installing the predefined assis- tants. let’s get started with installing the Manager Assistant using the following steps:

<!-- Page 168 -->

**144** CHAPTER 6 ***Building autonomous assistants***

1 Open Playground in your browser, and create a new simple assistant or use an existing assistant. If you need a new assistant, create it and then select it. 2 With the assistant selected, open the Actions accordion, and select the create_ manager_assistant action. You don’t need to save; the interface will update the assistant automatically. 3 Now, in the chat interface, prompt the assistant with the following: “Please cre- ate the manager assistant.” 4 After a few seconds, the assistant will say it’s done. Refresh your browser, and confirm that the Manager Assistant is now available. If, for some reason, the new assistant isn’t shown, try restarting the Gradio app itself.

The Manager Assistant is like an admin that has access to everything. When engag- ing the Manager Assistant, be sure to be specific about your requests. With the Man- ager Assistant active, you can now install new assistants used in the book using the following steps:

1 Select the Manager Assistant. If you’ve modified the Manager Assistant, you can delete it and reinstall it anytime. Although it’s possible to have multiple Man- ager Assistants, it’s not recommended. 2 Ask the Manager Assistant what assistants can be installed by typing the follow- ing in the chat interface:

Please list all the installable assistants.

3 Identify which assistant you want installed when you ask the Manager Assistant to install it:

Please install the Python Coding Assistant.

You can manage and install any available assistants using the Playground. You can also ask the Manager Assistant to save the definitions of all your assistants as JSON:

Please save all the assistants as JSON to a file called assistants.json.

The Manager Assistant can access all actions, which should be considered unique and used sparingly. When crafting assistants, it’s best to keep them goal specific and limit the actions to just what they need. This not only avoids giving the AI too many deci- sions but also avoids accidents or mistakes caused by hallucinations. As we go through the remaining exercises in this chapter, you’ll likely need to install the required assistants. Alternatively, you can ask the Manager Assistant to install all available assistants. Either way, we look at creating an ABT with assistants in the next section.

<!-- Page 169 -->

***6.3 Introducing agentic behavior trees* 145**
# 6.3.2 Building a coding challenge ABT

Coding challenges provide a good baseline for testing and evaluating agent and assis- tant systems. Challenges and benchmarks can quantify how well an agent or agentic system operates. We already applied coding challenges to multi-platform agents in chapter 4 with AutoGen and CrewAI. For this coding challenge, we’re going a little further and looking at Python cod- ing challenges from the Edabit site ([https://edabit.com](https://edabit.com)), which range in complexity from beginner to expert. We’ll stick with the expert code challenges because GPT-4o and other models are excellent coders. Look at the challenge in the next listing, and think about how you would solve it.

Listing 6.5 Edabit challenge: Plant the Grass

Plant the Grass by AniXDownLoe

You will be given a matrix representing a field g and two numbers x, y coordinate.

There are three types of possible characters in the matrix:

x representing a rock. o representing a dirt space. + representing a grassed space.

You have to simulate grass growing from the position (x, y). Grass can grow in all four directions (up, left, right, down). Grass can only grow on dirt spaces and can't go past rocks.

Return the simulated matrix. Examples

simulate_grass([ "xxxxxxx", "xooooox", "xxxxoox" "xoooxxx" "xxxxxxx"], 1, 1) → [ "xxxxxxx", "x+++++x", "xxxx++x" "xoooxxx" "xxxxxxx"]

Notes

There will always be rocks on the perimeter

You can use any challenge or coding exercise you want, but here are a few things to consider:

<!-- Page 170 -->

**146** CHAPTER 6 ***Building autonomous assistants***

- The challenge should be testable with quantifiable assertions (pass/fail).
- Avoid opening windows when asking for a game, building a website, or using another interface. At some point, testing full interfaces will be possible, but for now, it’s just text output.
- Avoid long-running challenges, at least initially. Start by keeping the challenges concise and short lived.
Along with any challenge, you’ll also want a set of tests or assertions to confirm the solution works. On Edabit, a challenge typically provides a comprehensive set of tests. The following listing shows the additional tests provided with the challenge.

Listing 6.6 Plant the Grass tests

Test.assert_equals(simulate_grass( ["xxxxxxx","xooooox","xxxxoox","xoooxxx","xxxxxxx"], 1, 1), ["xxxxxxx","x+++++x","xxxx++x","xoooxxx","xxxxxxx"]) Test.assert_equals(simulate_grass( ["xxxxxxx","xoxooox","xxoooox","xooxxxx", "xoxooox","xoxooox","xxxxxxx"], 2, 3), ["xxxxxxx","xox+++x","xx++++x","x++xxxx", "x+xooox","x+xooox","xxxxxxx"]) Test.assert_equals(simulate_grass( ["xxxxxx","xoxoox","xxooox","xoooox","xoooox","xxxxxx"], 1, 1), ["xxxxxx","x+xoox","xxooox","xoooox","xoooox","xxxxxx"]) Test.assert_equals(simulate_grass( ["xxxxx","xooox","xooox","xooox","xxxxx"], 1, 1), ["xxxxx","x+++x","x+++x","x+++x","xxxxx"]) Test.assert_equals(simulate_grass( ["xxxxxx","xxxxox","xxooox","xoooxx","xooxxx", "xooxxx","xxooox","xxxoxx","xxxxxx"], 4, 1), ["xxxxxx","xxxx+x","xx+++x","x+++xx","x++xxx", "x++xxx","xx+++x","xxx+xx","xxxxxx"]) Test.assert_equals(simulate_grass( ["xxxxxxxxxxx", "xoxooooooox", "xoxoxxxxxox", "xoxoxoooxox", "xoxoxoxoxox", "xoxoxoxoxox", "xoxoxxxoxox", "xoxoooooxox", "xoxxxxxxxox", "xooooooooox", "xxxxxxxxxxx"], 1, 1), ["xxxxxxxxxxx", "x+x+++++++x", "x+x+xxxxx+x", "x+x+x+++x+x", "x+x+x+x+x+x", "x+x+x+x+x+x", "x+x+xxx+x+x", "x+x+++++x+x", "x+xxxxxxx+x", "x+++++++++x", "xxxxxxxxxxx"])

The tests will be run as part of a two-step verification to confirm that the solution works. We’ll also use the tests and challenges as written, which will further test the AI.

Figure 6.8 shows the makeup of a straightforward behavior tree that will be used to

solve various programming challenges. You’ll notice that this ABT uses a different

assistant for the actions and conditions. For the first step, the Python coding assistant (called the Hacker) generates a solution that is then reviewed by the coding challenge Judge (called the Judge), which produces a refined solution that is verified by a differ- ent Python coding assistant (called the Verifier).

Figure 6.8 The ABT for the coding challenge

Figure 6.8 also shows how each agent converses on which thread. Assistants use mes-

sage threads, similar to a Slack or Discord channel, where all assistants conversing on a thread will see all messages. For this ABT, we keep one main conversation thread for the Hacker and Judge to share messages, while the Verifier works on a separate mes- sage thread. Keeping the Verifier on its own thread isolates it from the noise of the solution-solving efforts. Now, building the ABT in code is a matter of combining the py_trees package and the Playground API functions. Listing 6.7 shows an excerpt of code that creates each of the action/condition nodes with the assistants and gives them the instructions.

Run the ABT by loading the file in VS Code or using the command line. Follow the out- put in the terminal, and watch how the assistants work through each step in the tree. If the solution fails to be verified at the condition node, the process will continue per the tree. Even with this simple solution, you could quickly create numerous varia- tions. You could extend the tree with more nodes/steps and subtrees. Perhaps you want a team of Hackers to break down and analyze the challenge, for example. This example’s work is done mainly with the Playground code, using the helper functions create_assistant_condition and create_assistant_action_on_thread. This code uses a couple of classes to integrate the py_trees behavior tree code and the OpenAI Assistants code wrapped in the Playground. Review the code within the project if you want to understand the lower-level details.

# 6.3.3 Conversational AI systems vs. other methods

We already looked at conversational multi-agent systems in chapter 4 when we looked at AutoGen. The ABT can work using a combination of conversations (over threads) and other methods, such as file sharing. Having your assistants/agents pass files around helps reduce the number of noisy and repetitive thoughts/conversations. In contrast, conversational systems benefit from potential emergent behaviors. So, using both can help evolve better control and solutions. The simple solution in listing 6.7 could be extended to handle more real-world coding challenges and perhaps even to work as a coding ABT. In the next section, we build a different ABT to handle a different problem.

<!-- Page 174 -->

**150** CHAPTER 6 ***Building autonomous assistants***

## 6.3.4 Posting YouTube videos to X

In this section’s exercise, we look at an ABT that can do the following: 1 Search for videos on YouTube for a given topic and return the latest videos. 2 Download the transcripts for all the videos your search provided. 3 Summarize the transcripts. 4 Review the summarized transcripts and select a video to write an X (formerly Twitter) post about. 5 Write an exciting and engaging post about the video, ensuring it’s less than 280 characters. 6 Review the post and then post it on X.

Figure 6.9 shows the ABT assembled with each of the different assistants. In this exer-

cise, we use a sequence node for the root, and each assistant performs a different action. Also, to keep things simple, each assistant interaction will always occur in a new thread. This isolates each assistant’s interaction into a concise conversation that’s easier to debug if something goes wrong.

# →The root node is a sequence.

# 6.3.5 Required X setup

If you plan to run the code in this exercise, you must add your X credentials to the .env file. The .env.default file shows an example of how the credentials need to be, as shown in listing 6.8. You don’t have to enter your credentials. This means the last step, posting, will fail, but you can still look at the file (youtube_twitter_post.txt) to see what was generated.

Listing 6.8 Configuring credentials

X_EMAIL = "twitter email here" X_USERNAME = "twitter username here" X_PASSWORD = "twitter password here"

YouTube search and spam If you plan to run this exercise for real and let it post to your X account, be aware that YouTube has a bit of a spam problem. The assistants have been configured to try to avoid video spam, but some of it may get through. Building a working ABT that can wade through videos while avoiding spam has some suitable applications.

Listing 6.9 shows just the code for creating the assistant actions. This ABT uses three different assistants, each with its own task instructions. Note that each assistant has a unique set of instructions defining its role. You can review the instructions for each assistant by using the Playground.

Listing 6.9 **agentic_btree_video_poster_v1.py**

root = py_trees.composites.Sequence("RootSequence", memory=True)

search_term = "GPT Agents" search_youtube_action = create_assistant_action( action_name=f"Search YouTube({search_term})", assistant_name="YouTube Researcher v2", assistant_instructions=f""" Search Term: {search_term} Use the query "{search_term}" to search for videos on YouTube. then for each video download the transcript and summarize it for relevance to {search_term} be sure to include a link to each of the videos, and then save all summarizations to a file called youtube_transcripts.txt If you encounter any errors, please return just the word FAILURE.

If you encounter any errors, please return just the word FAILURE. """, ) root.add_child(write_post_action)

post_action = create_assistant_action( action_name="Post", assistant_name="Social Media Assistant", assistant_instructions=""" Load the file called youtube_twitter_post.txt and post the content to Twitter. If the content is empty please do not post anything. If you encounter any errors, please return just the word FAILURE. """, ) root.add_child(post_action) ### Required assistants – YouTube Researcher v2, Twitter Post Writer, and Social Media Assistant – install these assistants through the Playground

Run the code as you normally would, and after a few minutes, a new post will appear in the assistants_output folder. Figure 6.10 shows an example of a post generated using this ABT. Running this ABT to generate more than a few posts a day could, and likely will, get your X account blocked. If you’ve configured X credentials, you’ll see the post appear on your feed.

Figure 6.10 A sample X

This ABT is shown for demonstration purposes and isn’t for production or long-term use. The primary features of this demonstration are to show search and loading data, summarization and filtering, then generating new content, and finally highlighting multiple custom actions and integrations with APIs.

***6.4 Building conversational autonomous multi-agents* 153**
# 6.4 Building conversational autonomous multi-agents

The conversational aspect of multi-agent systems can drive mechanisms such as feed- back, reasoning, and emergent behaviors. Driving agents with ABTs that silo assis- tants/agents can be effective for controlling structured processes, as we saw in the YouTube posting example. However, we also don’t want to miss out on the benefits of conversation across agents/assistants. Fortunately, the Playground provides methods to silo or join assistants to conversation threads. Figure 6.11 shows how assistants can be siloed or mixed in various combinations to threads. Combining silos with conversation provides the best of both patterns.

Figure 6.11 The various layouts of siloed and conversational assistants

We’ll examine a simple but practical exercise to demonstrate the effectiveness of the conversational pattern. For the next exercise, we’ll employ two assistants in an ABT that converse over the same thread. The next listing shows the tree’s construction in code with the respective assistants.

Listing 6.10 **agentic_conversation_btree.py**

root = py_trees.composites.Sequence("RootSequence", memory=True) bug_file = """ # code not shown """

<!-- Page 178 -->

"""), ) root.add_child(debug_code) **Creates the verification** **condition to test if the code is fixed or not** verify = create_assistant_condition_on_thread( thread=thread, condition_name="Verify", assistant_name="Python Coding Assistant", assistant_instructions=textwrap.dedent( """ Verify the solution fixes the bug and there are no more issues. Verify that no exceptions are thrown when the code is run. Reply with SUCCESS if the solution is correct, otherwise return FAILURE. If you are happy with the solution, save the code to a file called fixed_bug.py. """, ), ) root.add_child(verify) tree = py_trees.trees.BehaviourTree(root) while True: **The tree will continue** tree.tick() **to run until the root** **sequence completes** if root.status == py_trees.common.Status.SUCCESS: **with success.** break time.sleep(20)

Three nodes comprise the tree: the root sequence, the debug code action, and the verify fix condition. Because the tree’s root is a sequence, the two assistants will con- tinue to work one after another until they both return with success. Both assistants converse on the same thread and yet are controlled in a manner that provides con- stant feedback. Run the exercise by loading the file in VS Code, or execute it directly from the command line. The example code has a few minor bugs and problems that the assis- tants will work through to fix. After the ABT completes running successfully, you can open the assistants_output/fixed_bug.py file and verify the results are all good. We’ve now seen a couple of ABTs in action and understand the nuances of using silos or conversations. The following section will teach you some techniques for build- ing your own ABTs.

<!-- Page 179 -->

***6.5 Building ABTs with back chaining* 155**
# 6.5 Building ABTs with back chaining

Back chaining is a method derived from logic and reasoning used to help build behav- ior trees by working backward from the goal. This section will use the back chaining process to construct an ABT that works to achieve the goal. The following list provides a description of the process in more detail:

1 *Identify goal behavior*. Start with the behavior you want the agent to perform. 2 *Determine the required actions*. Identify the actions that lead to the goal behavior. 3 *Identify the conditions*. Determine the conditions that must be met for each action to succeed. 4 *Determine the mode of communication*. Determine how the assistants will pass on information. Will the assistants be siloed or converse over threads, or is a combi- nation of patterns better? 5 *Construct the tree.* Start by building the behavior tree from the goal behavior, add- ing nodes for actions and conditions recursively until all necessary conditions are linked to known states or facts.

Behavior trees typically use a pattern called the *blackboard* to communicate across nodes. Blackboards, like those in py_trees, use a key/value store to save information and make it accessible across nodes. It also provides for several controls, such as limit- ing access to specific nodes. We deferred to using files for communication because of their simplicity and transparency. At some point, agentic systems are expected to consume much more information and in different formats than those designed for blackboards. Black- boards must either become more sophisticated or be integrated with file storage solutions. Let’s build an ABT using back chaining. We could tackle a variety of goals, but one interesting and perhaps meta goal is to build an ABT that helps build assistants. So let’s first present our goal as a statement “Create an assistant that can help me do {task}”:

- *Required actions*: (working backwards) – Create an assistant. – Verify the assistant. – Test the assistant. – Name the assistant. – Give the assistant the relevant instructions.
- *Identified condition:* – Verify the assistant.
- *Determine communication patterns*: To keep things interesting, we’ll run all assis- tants on the same message thread.

<!-- Page 180 -->

**156** CHAPTER 6 ***Building autonomous assistants***

- *Construct the tree*: To construct the tree, let’s first reverse the order of actions and mark each of the element’s actions and conditions accordingly: – (action) Give the assistant relevant instructions to help a user with a given task. – (action) Name the assistant. – (action) Test the assistant. – (condition) Verify the assistant. – (action) Create the assistant.
Of course, the simple solution to building the tree now is to ask ChatGPT or an oth- erwise capable model. The result of asking ChatGPT to make the tree is shown in the next listing. You could also work the tree out independently and perhaps intro- duce other elements.

Listing 6.11 ABT for building an assistant

Root │ ├── Sequence │ ├── Action: Give the assistant relevant instructions to help a user with a given task │ ├── Action: Name the assistant │ ├── Action: Test the assistant │ ├── Condition: Verify the assistant │ └── Action: Create the assistant

From this point, we can start building the tree by iterating over each action and condi- tion node and determining what instructions the assistant needs. This can also include any tools and custom actions, including ones you may need to develop. On your first pass, keep the instructions generic. Ideally, we want to create as few assistants as necessary. After determining the assistant, tools, and actions for each assistant and for which task, you can try to generalize things further. Think about where it may be possible to combine actions and reduce the number of assistants. It’s better to start evaluating with insufficient assistants than with too many. However, be sure to maintain the proper divisions of work as tasks: for example, testing and verification are best done with different assistants.

# Summary

- Behavior trees are a robust and scalable AI control pattern, first introduced in robotics by Rodney A. Brooks. They are widely used in gaming and robotics for their modularity and reusability.
- The primary nodes in behavior trees are the selector, sequence, condition, action, decorator, and parallel nodes. Selectors are like “or” blocks: sequence exe- cutes nodes in sequence, condition tests the state, action does the work, decora- tor is a wrapper, and parallel nodes allow for dual execution.
- Understanding the execution flow of behavior trees can be critical to designing, building, and operating them to provide control for making clear decision- making paths.
- The advantages of behavior trees include modularity, scalability, flexibility, debug- ging ease, and decoupling of decision logic, making behavior trees suitable for complex AI systems.
- Setting up and running a simple behavior tree in Python requires correctly naming and documenting custom nodes.
- The GPT Assistants Playground project is a Gradio-based interface that mimics the OpenAI Assistants Playground with additional features for teaching and demonstrating ABTs.
- The GPT Assistants Playground allows for creating and managing custom actions, which is essential for building versatile assistants.

<!-- Page 183 -->

***Summary* 159**

- ABTs control agents and assistants by using prompts to direct actions and condi- tions for assistants. ABTs use the power of LLMs to create dynamic and autono- mous systems.
- Back chaining is a method for constructing behavior trees by working backward from the goal behavior. This process involves identifying required actions, condi- tions, and communication patterns, and then constructing the tree step by step.
- Agentic systems benefit from siloed and conversation patterns for communicat- ing between entities. ABTs can benefit from combining siloed and conversa- tional assistants to use structured processes and emergent behaviors.

# Assembling and using an agent platform

## This chapter covers

- Nexus chat and dashboard interface for AI agents
- Streamlit framework for building intelligent dashboards, prototypes, and AI chat apps
- Developing, testing, and engaging agent profiles and personas in Nexus
- Developing the base Nexus agent
- Developing, testing, and engaging agent actions and tools alone or within Nexus
After we explored some basic concepts about agents and looked at using actions with tools to build prompts and personas using frameworks such as the Semantic Kernel (SK), we took the first steps toward building a foundation for this book. That foundation is called Nexus, an agent platform designed to be simple to learn, easy to explore, and powerful enough to build your agent systems.

<!-- Page 185 -->

***7.1 Introducing Nexus, not just another agent platform* 161**
# 7.1 Introducing Nexus, not just another agent platform

There are more than 100 AI platforms and toolkits for consuming and developing large language model (LLM) applications, ranging from toolkits such as SK or Lang- Chain to complete platforms such as AutoGen and CrewAI. This makes it difficult to decide which platform is well suited to building your own AI agents. Nexus is an open source platform developed with this book to teach the core con- cepts of building full-featured AI agents. In this chapter, we’ll examine how Nexus is built and introduce two primary agent components: profiles/personas and actions/tools.

Figure 7.1 shows the primary interface to Nexus, a Streamlit chat application that

allows you to choose and explore various agentic features. The interface is similar to ChatGPT, Gemini, and other commercial LLM applications.

Figure 7.1 The Nexus interface and features

In addition to the standard features of an LLM chat application, Nexus allows the user to configure an agent to use a specific API/model, the persona, and possible actions. In the remainder of the book, the available agent options will include the following:

- *Personas/profiles*—The primary persona and profile the agent will use. A persona is the personality and primary motivator, and an agent engages the persona to

<!-- Page 186 -->

**162** CHAPTER 7 ***Assembling and using an agent platform***

answer requests. We’ll look in this chapter at how personas/profiles can be developed and consumed.

- *Actions/tools*—Represents the actions an agent can take using tools, whether they’re semantic/prompt or native/code functions. In this chapter, we’ll look at how to build both semantic and native functions within Nexus.
- *Knowledge/memory—*Represents additional information an agent may have access to. At the same time, agent memory can represent various aspects, from short- term to semantic memory.
- *Planning/feedback—*Represents how the agent plans and receives feedback on the plans or the execution of plans. Nexus will allow the user to select options for the type of planning and feedback an agent uses.
As we progress through this book, Nexus will be added to support new agent features. However, simultaneously, the intent will be to keep things relatively simple to teach many of these essential core concepts. In the next section, we’ll look at how to quickly use Nexus before going under the hood to explore features in detail.

# 7.1.1 Running Nexus

Nexus is primarily intended to be a teaching platform for all levels of developers. As such, it will support various deployment and usage options. In the next exercise, we’ll introduce how to get up and running with Nexus quickly. Open a terminal to a new Python virtual environment (version 3.10). If you need assistance creating one, refer to appendix B. Then, execute the commands shown in listing 7.1 within this new environment. You can either set the environment variable at the command line or create a new .env file and add the setting.

Listing 7.1 Terminal command line

**Installs the package directly from the**

pip install git+[https://github.com/cxbxmxcx/Nexus.git](https://github.com/cxbxmxcx/Nexus.git) **repository and** **branch; be sure to** #set your OpenAI API Key **include the branch.** export OPENAI_API_KEY=”< your API key>” or **Creates the key as an** $env: OPENAI_API_KEY = =”< your API key>” **environment variable or** **creates a new .env file** or **with the setting** echo 'OPENAI_API_KEY="<your API key>"' > .env

nexus run **Runs the application**

After entering the last command, a website will launch with a login page, as shown in

figure 7.2. Go ahead and create a new user. A future version of Nexus will allow multi-

ple users to engage in chat threads. After you log in, you’ll see a page like figure 7.1. Create a new chat and start con- versing with an agent. If you encounter a problem, be sure you have the API key set

properly. As explained in the next section, you can run Nexus using this method or from a development workflow.

# 7.1.2 Developing Nexus

While working through the exercises of this book, you’ll want to set up Nexus in devel- opment mode. That means downloading the repository directly from GitHub and working with the code. Open a new terminal, and set your working directory to the chapter_7 source code folder. Then, set up a new Python virtual environment (version 3.10) and enter the commands shown in listing 7.2. Again, refer to appendix B if you need assistance with any previous setup.

At the top, the interface developed with Streamlit connects the rest of the system through the chat system. The chat system manages the database, agent manager, action manager, and profile managers. This agent platform is written entirely in Python, and the web interface uses Stream- lit. In the next section, we look at how to build an OpenAI LLM chat application.

# 7.2 Introducing Streamlit for chat application development

Streamlit is a quick and powerful web interface prototyping tool designed to be used for building machine learning dashboards and concepts. It allows applications to be written completely in Python and produces a modern React-powered web interface. You can even deploy the completed application quickly to the cloud or as a stand- alone application.

## 7.2.1 Building a Streamlit chat application

Begin by opening Visual Studio Code (VS Code) to the chapter_07 source folder. If you’ve completed the previous exercise, you should already be ready. As always, if you need assistance setting up your environment and tools, refer to appendix B.

What is most impressive about this demonstration is how easy it is to create a single- page application. In the next section, we’ll continue looking at this application but with a few enhancements.

# 7.2.2 Creating a streaming chat application

Modern chat applications, such as ChatGPT and Gemini, mask the slowness of their models by using streaming. Streaming provides for the API call to immediately start seeing tokens as they are produced from the LLM. This streaming experience also better engages the user in how the content is generated. Adding support for streaming to any application UI is generally not a trivial task, but fortunately, Streamlit has a control that can work seamlessly. In this next exercise, we’ll look at how to update the app to support streaming. Open chapter_7/chatgpt_clone_streaming.py in VS Code. The relevant updates to the code are shown in listing 7.6. Using the st.write_stream control allows the UI

**170** CHAPTER 7 ***Assembling and using an agent platform***

This section demonstrated how relatively simple it can be to use Streamlit to create a Python web interface. Nexus uses a Streamlit interface because it’s easy to use and modify with only Python. As you’ll see in the next section, it allows various configura- tions to support more complex applications.

# 7.3 Developing profiles and personas for agents

Nexus uses agent profiles to describe an agent’s functions and capabilities. Figure 7.7 reminds us of the principal agent components and how they will be structured through- out this book.

**The Agent Profile fritz.yaml-Agent Profile Definition**

**Persona** Represents the background and role of the agent, and is often introduced in the first system message

Figure 7.7 The agent profile as it’s mapped to the YAML file definition

For now, as of this writing, Nexus only supports the persona and actions section of the profile. Figure 7.7 shows a profile called Fritz, along with the persona and actions. Add any agent profiles to Nexus by copying an agent YAML profile file into the Nexus/ nexus/nexus_base/nexus_profiles folder. Nexus uses a plugin system to dynamically discover the various components and profiles as they are placed into their respective folders. The nexus_profiles folder holds the YAML definitions for the agent.

# 7.4 Powering the agent and understanding the agent engine

Agent engines power agents within Nexus. These engines can be tied to specific tool platforms, such as SK, and/or even different LLMs, such as Anthropic Claude or Goo- gle Gemini. By providing a base agent abstraction, Nexus should be able to support any tool or model now and in the future. Currently, Nexus only implements an OpenAI API–powered agent. We’ll look at how the base agent is defined by opening the agent_manager.py file from the Nexus/ nexus/nexus_base folder. Listing 7.9 shows the BaseAgent class functions. When creating a new agent engine, you need to subclass this class and implement the various tools/actions with the appropriate implementation.

Listing 7.9 **agent_manager.py:BaseAgent**

class BaseAgent: def __init__(self, chat_history=None): self._chat_history = chat_history or [] self.last_message = "" self._actions = [] self._profile = None

#... not shown – property setters/getters

Open the nexus_agents/oai_agent.py file in VS Code. Listing 7.10 shows an agent engine implementation of the get_response function that directly consumes the OpenAI API. self.client is an OpenAI client created earlier during class initializa- tion, and the rest of the code you’ve seen used in earlier examples.

Listing 7.10 **oai_agent.py** (**get_response**)

async def get_response(self, user_input, thread_id=None): **Adds the user_input** self.messages += [{"role": "user", **to the message stack** "content": user_input}] response = self.client.chat.completions.create( **The client was created** model=self.model, **earlier and is now used to** messages=self.messages, **create chat completions.**

Like the agent profiles, Nexus uses a plugin system that allows you to place new agent engine definitions in the nexus_agents folder. If you create your agent, it just needs to be placed in this folder for Nexus to discover. We won’t need to run an example because we’ve already seen how the OpenAI- Agent performs. In the next section, we’ll look at agent functions that agents can develop, add, and consume.

# 7.5 Giving an agent actions and tools

Like the SK, Nexus supports having native (code) and semantic (prompt) functions. Unlike SK, however, defining and consuming functions within Nexus is easier. All you need to do is write functions into a Python file and place them into the nexus_ actions folder. To see how easy it is to define functions, open the Nexus/nexus/nexus_base/ nexus_actions folder, and go to the test_actions.py file. Listing 7.11 shows two function definitions. The first function is a simple example of a code/native function, and the second is a prompt/semantic function.

Listing 7.11 **test_actions.py** (native/semantic function definitions)

from nexus.nexus_base.action_manager import agent_action

**Applies the agent_action decorator to make a**

@agent_action **function an action** def get_current_weather(location, unit="fahrenheit"): """Get the current weather in a given location""" **Sets a descriptive** return f""" **comment for the** The current weather in {location} is 0 {unit}. **function** """ **The code can be as simple** **Applies the agent_action or complex as needed.** @agent_action **decorator to make a** def recommend(topic): **function an action** """ System: **The function** Provide a recommendation for a given {{topic}}. **comment becomes** Use your best judgment to provide a recommendation. **the prompt and** User: **can include** please use your best judgment **placeholders.** to provide a recommendation for {{topic}}. """ pass **Semantic functions don’t implement any code.**

<!-- Page 199 -->

***7.5 Giving an agent actions and tools* 175**
Place both functions in the nexus_actions folder, and they will be automatically dis- covered. Adding the agent_action decorator allows the functions to be inspected and automatically generates the OpenAI standard tool specification. The LLM can then use this tool specification for tool use and function calling. Listing 7.12 shows the generated OpenAI tool specification for both functions, as shown previously in listing 7.11. The semantic function, which uses a prompt, also applies to the tool description. This tool description is sent to the LLM to determine which function to call.

Listing 7.12 **test_actions**: OpenAI-generated tool specifications

{ "type": "function", "function": { **The function** "name": "get_current_weather", **comment becomes** "description": **the function tool** "Get the current weather in a given location", **description.** "parameters": { "type": "object", "properties": { **The input parameters of the** "location": { **function are extracted and** "type": "string", **added to the specification.** "description": "location" }, "unit": { "type": "string", "enum": [ "celsius", "fahrenheit"] } }, "required": [ "location"] } } } { "type": "function", "function": { "name": "recommend", "description": """ System: Provide a recommendation for a given {{topic}}.

<!-- Page 200 -->

**176** CHAPTER 7 ***Assembling and using an agent platform***

"topic": { "type": "string", "description": "topic" } }, "required": [ "topic"] } } }

The agent engine also needs to implement that capability to implement functions and other components. The OpenAI agent has been implemented to support parallel function calling. Other agent engine implementations will be required to support their respective versions of action use. Fortunately, the definition of the OpenAI tool is becoming the standard, and many platforms adhere to this standard. Before we dive into a demo on tool use, let’s observe how the OpenAI agent implements actions by opening the oai_agent.py file in VS Code. The following list- ing shows the top of the agent’s get_response_stream function and its implementa- tion of function calling.

Listing 7.13 Caling the API in **get_response_stream**

def get_response_stream(self, user_input, thread_id=None): **Detects whether** **the agent has** self.last_message = "" **any available** self.messages += [{"role": "user", "content": user_input}] **tools turned on** if self.tools and len(self.tools) > 0: response = self.client.chat.completions.create( model=self.model, messages=self.messages, **Sets the tools in the** **chat completions call** tools=self.tools, tool_choice="auto", **Ensures that the** ) **LLM knows it can** else: **choose any tool** response = self.client.chat.completions.create( model=self.model, **If no tools, calls the** messages=self.messages, **LLM the standard way** ) response_message = response.choices[0].message **Detects whether there** tool_calls = response_message.tool_calls **were any tools used by** **the LLM**

Executing the functions follows, as shown in listing 7.14. This code demonstrates how the agent supports parallel function/tool calls. These calls are parallel because the agent executes each one together and in no order. In chapter 11, we’ll look at plan- ners that allow actions to be called in ordered sequences.

<!-- Page 201 -->

***7.5 Giving an agent actions and tools* 177**
Listing 7.14 **oai_agent.py** (**get_response_stream**: execute tool calls)

**Proceeds if tool calls are detected** if tool_calls: **in the LLM response** available_functions = { action["name"]: action["pointer"] for action in self.actions } self.messages.append( **Loads pointers to the actual function** response_message **implementations for code execution** ) for tool_call in tool_calls: **Loops through** function_name = tool_call.function.name **all the calls the** function_to_call = available_functions[function_name] **LLM wants to** function_args = json.loads(tool_call.function.arguments) **call; there can** function_response = function_to_call( **be several.** **function_args, _caller_agent=self )

To demo this, start up Nexus in the debugger by pressing F5. Then, select the two test actions—recommend and get_current_weather—and the terse persona/profile Olly.

Figure 7.9 shows the result of entering a query and the agent responding by using

both tools in its response. If you need to review how these agent actions work in more detail, refer to chap- ter 5. The underlying code is more complex and out of the scope of review here. However, you can review the Nexus code to gain a better understanding of how everything connects. Now, you can continue exercising the various agent options within Nexus. Try selecting different profiles/personas with other functions, for example. In the next chapter, we unveil how agents can consume external memory and knowledge using patterns such as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).

# Understanding agent memory and knowledge

## This chapter covers

- Retrieval in knowledge/memory in AI functions
- Building retrieval augmented generation workflows with LangChain
- Retrieval augmented generation for agentic knowledge systems in Nexus
- Retrieval patterns for memory in agents
- Improving augmented retrieval systems with memory and knowledge compression
Now that we’ve explored agent actions using external tools, such as plugins in the form of native or semantic functions, we can look at the role of memory and knowl- edge using retrieval in agents and chat interfaces. We’ll describe memory and knowledge and how they relate to prompt engineering strategies, and then, to under- stand memory knowledge, we’ll investigate document indexing, construct retrieval systems with LangChain, use memory with LangChain, and build semantic memory using Nexus.

<!-- Page 205 -->

***8.1 Understanding retrieval in AI applications* 181**
# 8.1 Understanding retrieval in AI applications

Retrieval in agent and chat applications is a mechanism for obtaining knowledge to keep in storage that is typically external and long-lived. Unstructured knowledge includes conversation or task histories, facts, preferences, or other items necessary for contextualizing a prompt. Structured knowledge, typically stored in databases or files, is accessed through native functions or plugins. Memory and knowledge, as shown in figure 8.1, are elements used to add further context and relevant information to a prompt. Prompts can be augmented with every- thing from information about a document to previous tasks or conversations and other reference information.

The prompt engineering strategies shown in figure 8.1 can be applied to memory and knowledge. Knowledge isn’t considered memory but rather an augmentation of the prompt from existing documents. Both knowledge and memory use retrieval as the basis for how unstructured information can be queried.

<!-- Page 206 -->

**182** CHAPTER 8 ***Understanding agent memory and knowledge***

The retrieval mechanism, called retrieval augmented generation (RAG), has become a standard for providing relevant context to a prompt. The exact mechanism that powers RAG also powers memory/knowledge, and it’s essential to understand how it works. In the next section, we’ll examine what RAG is.

# 8.2 The basics of retrieval augmented generation (RAG)

RAG has become a popular mechanism for supporting document chat or question- and-answer chat. The system typically works by a user supplying a relevant document, such as a PDF, and then using RAG and a large language model (LLM) to query the document.

Figure 8.2 shows how RAG can allow a document to be queried using an LLM.

Before any document can be queried, it must first be loaded, transformed into con- text chunks, embedded into vectors, and stored in a vector database.

**Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**

# 8.3 Delving into semantic search and document indexing

Document indexing transforms a document’s information to be more easily recov- ered. How the index will be queried or searched also plays a factor, whether searching for a particular set of words or wanting to match phrase for phrase. A *semantic* search is a search for content that matches the searched phrase by words and meaning. The ability to search by meaning, semantically, is potent and worth investigating in some detail. In the next section, we look at how vector similarity search can lay the framework for semantic search.

## 8.3.1 Applying vector similarity search

Let’s look now at how a document can be transformed into a *semantic vector,* or a repre- sentation of text that can then be used to perform distance or similarity matching. There are numerous ways to convert text into a semantic vector, so we’ll look at a sim- ple one. Open the chapter_08 folder in a new Visual Studio Code (VS Code) workspace. Create a new environment and pip install the requirements.txt file for all the chapter dependencies. If you need help setting up a new Python environment, con- sult appendix B. Now open the document_vector_similarity.py file in VS Code, and review the top section in listing 8.1. This example uses Term Frequency–Inverse Document Fre- quency (TF–IDF). This numerical statistic reflects how important a word is to a docu- ment in a collection or set of documents by increasing proportionally to the number of times a word appears in the document and offset by the frequency of the word in the document set. TF–IDF is a classic measure of understanding one document’s importance within a set of documents.

Listing 8.1 **document_vector_similarity** (transform to vector)

import plotly.graph_objects as go from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

documents = [ **Samples of documents** "The sky is blue and beautiful.", "Love this blue and beautiful sky!", "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.", "A king's breakfast has sausages, ham, bacon, eggs, toast, and beans", "I love green eggs, ham, sausages and bacon!", "The brown fox is quick and the blue dog is lazy!", "The sky is very blue and the sky is very beautiful today", "The dog is lazy but the brown fox is quick!"] **Vectorization** vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer() **using TF–IDF** X = vectorizer.fit_transform(documents) **Vectorize the documents.**

<!-- Page 209 -->

***8.3 Delving into semantic search and document indexing* 185**
Let’s break down TF–IDF into its two components using the sample sentence, “The sky is blue and beautiful,” and focusing on the word *blue*. TERM FREQUENCY (TF) *Term Frequency* measures how frequently a term occurs in a document. Because we’re considering only a single document (our sample sentence), the simplest form of the TF for *blue* can be calculated as the number of times *blue* appears in the document divided by the total number of words in the document. Let’s calculate it:

Number of times *blue* appears in the document: 1

Total number of words in the document: 6

TF = 1 ÷ 6TF = .16 INVERSE DOCUMENT FREQUENCY (IDF) *Inverse Document Frequency* measures how important a term is within the entire corpus. It’s calculated by dividing the total number of documents by the number of docu- ments containing the term and then taking the logarithm of that quotient:

IDF = log(Total number of documents ÷ Number of documents containing the word)

In this example, the corpus is a small collection of eight documents, and *blue* appears in four of these documents.

IDF = log(8 ÷ 4) TF–IDF CALCULATION Finally, the TF–IDF score for *blue* in our sample sentence is calculated by multiplying the TF and the IDF scores:

## TF–IDF = TF × IDF

Let’s compute the actual values for TF–IDF for the word *blue* using the example pro- vided; first, the term frequency (how often the word occurs in the document) is com- puted as follows:

## TF = 1 ÷ 6

Assuming the base of the logarithm is 10 (commonly used), the inverse document fre- quency is computed as follows:

## IDF = log10 (8 ÷ 4)

Now let’s calculate the exact TF–IDF value for the word *blue* in the sentence, “The sky is blue and beautiful”:

<!-- Page 210 -->

**186** CHAPTER 8 ***Understanding agent memory and knowledge***

The Term Frequency (TF) is approximately 0.1670.

The Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) is approximately 0.301.

Thus, the TF–IDF (TF × IDF) score for *blue* is approximately 0.050.

This TF–IDF score indicates the relative importance of the word *blue* in the given doc- ument (the sample sentence) within the context of the specified corpus (eight docu- ments, with *blue* appearing in four of them). Higher TF–IDF scores imply greater importance. We use TF–IDF here because it’s simple to apply and understand. Now that we have the elements represented as vectors, we can measure document similarity using cosine similarity. Cosine similarity is a measure used to calculate the cosine of the angle between two nonzero vectors in a multidimensional space, indicating how simi- lar they are, irrespective of their size.

Figure 8.4 shows how cosine distance compares the vector representations of two

pieces or documents of text. Cosine similarity returns a value from –1 (not similar) to 1 (identical). *Cosine distance* is a normalized value ranging from 0 to 2, derived by tak- ing 1 minus the cosine similarity. A cosine distance of 0 means identical items, and 2 indicates complete opposites.

**Cosine Similarity**

The sky is blue and beautiful.

**Vector representations of the text rendered in 2D and in reality vectors can be highly dimensional.**

Love this blue and beautiful sky!

θ**The angle or distance is a measure of how** **close the vectors are in space. It also** Cosine Distance **represents their similarity to each other.**

Figure 8.4 How cosine

similarity is measured

Listing 8.2 shows how the cosine similarities are computed using the cosine_similarity function from scikit-learn. Similarities are calculated for each document against all other documents in the set. The computed matrix of similarities for documents is stored in the cosine_similarities variable. Then, in the input loop, the user can select the document to view its similarities to the other documents.

<!-- Page 211 -->

***8.3 Delving into semantic search and document indexing* 187**

mode). After you select a document, you’ll see the similarities between the various documents in the set. A document will have a cosine similarity of 1 with itself. Note that you won’t see a negative similarity because of the TF–IDF vectorization. We’ll look later at other, more sophisticated means of measuring semantic similarity.

<!-- Page 212 -->

**188** CHAPTER 8 ***Understanding agent memory and knowledge***

The method of vectorization will dictate the measure of semantic similarity between documents. Before we move on to better methods of vectorizing documents, we’ll examine storing vectors to perform vector similarity searches.

# 8.3.2 Vector databases and similarity search

After vectorizing documents, they can be stored in a vector database for later similar- ity searches. To demonstrate how this works, we can efficiently replicate a simple vec- tor database in Python code. Open document_vector_database.py in VS Code, as shown in listing 8.3. This code demonstrates creating a vector database in memory and then allowing users to enter text to search the database and return results. The results returned show the document text and the similarity score.

Listing 8.3 **document_vector_database.py**

# code above omitted vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer() **Stores the** **document vectors** X = vectorizer.fit_transform(documents) **into an array** vector_database = X.toarray()

def cosine_similarity_search(query, **The function to perform** database, **similarity matching on** vectorizer, **query returns, matches,** **and similarity scores** top_n=5): query_vec = vectorizer.transform([query]).toarray() similarities = cosine_similarity(query_vec, database)[0] top_indices = np.argsort(-similarities)[:top_n] # Top n indices return [(idx, similarities[idx]) for idx in top_indices]

while True: **The main** query = input("Enter a search query (or 'exit' to stop): ") **input loop** if query.lower() == 'exit': break top_n = int(input("How many top matches do you want to see? ")) search_results = cosine_similarity_search(query, vector_database, vectorizer, top_n)

print("Top Matched Documents:") for idx, score in search_results: print(f"- {documents[idx]} (Score: {score:.4f})") **Loops through results and**

print("\n") **outputs text and** ###Output **similarity score** Enter a search query (or 'exit' to stop): blue How many top matches do you want to see? 3 Top Matched Documents:

- The sky is blue and beautiful. (Score: 0.4080)
- Love this blue and beautiful sky! (Score: 0.3439)
- The brown fox is quick and the blue dog is lazy! (Score: 0.2560)

<!-- Page 213 -->

***8.3 Delving into semantic search and document indexing* 189**
Run this exercise to see the output (F5 in VS Code). Enter any text you like, and see the results of documents being returned. This search form works well for matching words and phrases with similar words and phrases. This form of search misses the word context and meaning from the document. In the next section, we’ll look at a way of transforming documents into vectors that better preserves their semantic meaning.

# 8.3.3 Demystifying document embeddings

TF–IDF is a simple form that tries to capture semantic meaning in documents. How- ever, it’s unreliable because it only counts word frequency and doesn’t understand the relationships between words. A better and more modern method uses document embedding, a form of document vectorizing that better preserves the semantic mean- ing of the document. Embedding networks are constructed by training neural networks on large data- sets to map words, sentences, or documents to high-dimensional vectors, capturing semantic and syntactic relationships based on context and relationships in the data. You typically use a pretrained model trained on massive datasets to embed documents and perform embeddings. Models are available from many sources, including Hug- ging Face and, of course, OpenAI. In our next scenario, we’ll use an OpenAI embedding model. These models are typically perfect for capturing the semantic context of embedded documents. Listing

8.4 shows the relevant code that uses OpenAI to embed the documents into vectors that are then reduced to three dimensions and rendered into a plot. Listing 8.4 **document_visualizing_embeddings.py** (relevant sections) load_dotenv() api_key = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY') if not api_key:
**Join all the items on the string ', '.** raise ValueError("No API key found. Please check your .env file.") client = OpenAI(api_key=api_key)

def get_embedding(text, model="text-embedding-ada-002"): text = text.replace("\n", " ") **Uses the OpenAI** return client.embeddings.create(input=[text], **client to create** model=model).data[0].embedding **the embedding**

# Sample documents (omitted) **Generates embeddings** **for each document of** embeddings = [get_embedding(doc) for doc in documents] **size 1536 dimensions** print(embeddings_array.shape) **Converts embeddings to** embeddings_array = np.array(embeddings) **a NumPy array for PCA**

pca = PCA(n_components=3) **Applies PCA to** reduced_embeddings = pca.fit_transform(embeddings_array) **reduce dimensions to 3 for plotting**

<!-- Page 214 -->

**190** CHAPTER 8 ***Understanding agent memory and knowledge***

When a document is embedded using an OpenAI model, it transforms the text into a vector with dimensions of 1536. We can’t visualize this number of dimensions, so we use a dimensionality reduction technique via principal component analysis (PCA) to convert the vector of size 1536 to 3 dimensions.

Figure 8.6 shows the output generated from running the file in VS Code. By reduc-

ing the embeddings to 3D, we can plot the output to show how semantically similar documents are now grouped.

**Similar documents are now similar in meaning and are shown grouped together.**

**Documents are projected to 3D based on their semantic meaning.**

Figure 8.6 Embeddings in 3D, showing how similar semantic documents are grouped

The choice of which embedding model or service you use is up to you. The OpenAI embedding models are considered the best for general semantic similarity. This has made these models the standard for most memory and retrieval applications. With our understanding of how text can be vectorized with embeddings and stored in a vec- tor database, we can move on to a more realistic example in the next section.

# 8.3.4 Querying document embeddings from Chroma

We can combine all the pieces and look at a complete example using a local vector database called Chroma DB. Many vector database options exist, but Chroma DB is an excellent local vector store for development or small-scale projects. There are also plenty of more robust options that you can consider later.

<!-- Page 215 -->

***8.3 Delving into semantic search and document indexing* 191**
Listing 8.5 shows the new and relevant code sections from the document_query_ chromadb.py file. Note that the results are scored by distance and not by similarity. Cosine distance is determined by this equation:

Cosine Distance(A,B) = 1 – Cosine Similarity(A,B)

This means that cosine distance will range from 0 for most similar to 2 for semanti- cally opposite in meaning.

Listing 8.5 **document_query_chromadb.py** (relevant code sections)

embeddings = [get_embedding(doc) for doc in documents] **Generates embeddings** ids = [f"id{i}" for i in range(len(documents))] **for each document and** **assigns an ID** chroma_client = chromadb.Client() **Creates a Chroma DB** collection = chroma_client.create_collection( **client and a collection** name="documents") collection.add( **Adds document** embeddings=embeddings, **embeddings to** documents=documents, **the collection** ids=ids )

def query_chromadb(query, top_n=2): **Queries the datastore** query_embedding = get_embedding(query) **and returns the top n** results = collection.query( **relevant documents** query_embeddings=[query_embedding], n_results=top_n ) return [(id, score, text) for id, score, text in zip(results['ids'][0], results['distances'][0], results['documents'][0])]

while True: query = input("Enter a search query (or 'exit' to stop): ") if query.lower() == 'exit': break top_n = int(input("How many top matches do you want to see? ")) search_results = query_chromadb(query, top_n) **The input loop for** print("Top Matched Documents:") **user input and output of** for id, score, text in search_results: **relevant documents/scores** print(f""" ID:{id} TEXT: {text} SCORE: {round(score, 2)} """)

ID:id5 TEXT: The brown fox is quick and the blue dog is lazy! SCORE: 0.28 ID:id2 TEXT: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. SCORE: 0.29

As the earlier scenario demonstrated, you can now query the documents using seman- tic meaning rather than just key terms or phrases. These scenarios should now pro- vide the background to see how the retrieval pattern works at a low level. In the next section, we’ll see how the retrieval pattern can be employed using LangChain.

# 8.4 Constructing RAG with LangChain

LangChain began as an open source project specializing in abstracting the retrieval pattern across multiple data sources and vector stores. It has since morphed into much more, but foundationally, it still provides excellent options for implementing retrieval.

Figure 8.7 shows a diagram from LangChain that identifies the process of storing

documents for retrieval. These same steps may be replicated in whole or in part to implement memory retrieval. The critical difference between document and memory retrieval is the source and how content is transformed.

**LangChain supports**

Figure 8.7 Load, transform, embed, and store steps in storing documents for later retrieval

We’ll examine how to implement each of these steps using LangChain and under- stand the nuances and details accompanying this implementation. In the next section, we’ll start by splitting and loading documents with LangChain.

## 8.4.1 Splitting and loading documents with LangChain

Retrieval mechanisms augment the context of a given prompt with specific informa- tion relevant to the request. For example, you may request detailed information about

<!-- Page 217 -->

***8.4 Constructing RAG with LangChain* 193**
a local document. With earlier language models, submitting the whole document as part of the prompt wasn’t an option due to token limitations. Today, we could submit a whole document for many commercial LLMs, such as GPT-4 Turbo, as part of a prompt request. However, the results may not be better and would likely cost more because of the increased number of tokens. Therefore, a better option is to split the document and use the relevant parts to request context—pre- cisely what RAG and memory do. Splitting a document is essential in breaking down content into semantically and specifically relevant sections. Figure 8.8 shows how to break down an HTML docu- ment containing the Mother Goose nursery rhymes. Often, splitting a document into contextual semantic chunks requires careful consideration.

**Load the document(s). Split the documents into chunks.**

**Create embeddings Store**

**Ideally, the chunks are semantically relevant**

**and specific.**

Figure 8.8 How the document would ideally be split into chunks for better semantic and contextual meaning

Ideally, when we split documents into chunks, they are broken down by relevance and semantic meaning. While an LLM or agent could help us with this, we’ll look at cur- rent toolkit options within LangChain for splitting documents. Later in this chapter, we’ll look at a semantic function that can assist us in semantically dividing content for embeddings. For the next exercise, open langchain_load_splitting.py in VS Code, as shown in listing 8.6. This code shows where we left off from listing 8.5, in the previous sec- tion. Instead of using the sample documents, we’re loading the Mother Goose nursery rhymes this time.

<!-- Page 218 -->

SCORE: 0.4…

Note in listing 8.6 that the HTML document gets split into 100-character chunks with a 25-character overlap. The overlap allows the document’s parts not to cut off specific thoughts. We selected the splitter for this exercise because it was easy to use, set up, and understand. Go ahead and run the langchain_load_splitting.py file in VS Code (F5). Enter a query, and see what results you get. The output in listing 8.6 shows good results given a specific example. Remember that we only embedded 250 document chunks to reduce costs and keep the exercise short. Of course, you can always try to embed the entire document or use a minor input document example. Perhaps the most critical element to building proper retrieval is the process of document splitting. You can use numerous methods to split a document, including multiple concurrent methods. More than one method passes and splits the docu- ment for numerous embedding views of the same document. In the next section, we’ll examine a more general technique for splitting documents, using tokens and tokenization.

<!-- Page 219 -->

***8.4 Constructing RAG with LangChain* 195**
# 8.4.2 Splitting documents by token with LangChain

*Tokenization* is the process of breaking text into word tokens. Where a word token rep- resents a succinct element in the text, a token could be a word like *hold* or even a sym- bol like the left curly brace ({), depending on what’s relevant. Splitting documents using tokenization provides a better base for how the text will be interpreted by language models and for semantic similarity. Tokenization also allows the removal of irrelevant characters, such as whitespace, making the similarity matching of documents more relevant and generally providing better results. For the next code exercise, open the langchain_token_splitting.py file in VS Code, as shown in listing 8.7. Now we split the document using tokenization, which breaks the document into sections of unequal size. The unequal size results from the large sections of whitespace of the original document.

Listing 8.7 **langchain_token_splitting.py** (relevant new code)

loader = UnstructuredHTMLLoader("sample_documents/mother_goose.html") data = loader.load() text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter.from_tiktoken_encoder( chunk_size=50, chunk_overlap=10 **Updates to 50 tokens** ) **and overlap of 10 tokens** documents = text_splitter.split_documents(data) documents = [doc for doc in documents][8:94] **Selects just the** **documents that** db = Chroma.from_documents(documents, OpenAIEmbeddings()) **contain rhymes**

Georgy Porgy, pudding and pie, Kissed the girls and made them cry.

Run the langchain_token_splitting.py code in VS Code (F5). You can use the query we used last time or your own. Notice how the results are significantly better than the previous exercise. However, the results are still suspect because the query uses several similar words in the same order. A better test would be to try a semantically similar phrase but one that uses differ- ent words and check the results. With the code still running, enter a new phrase to

query: Why are the girls crying? Listing 8.8 shows the results of executing that query. If you run this example yourself and scroll down over the output, you’ll see Georgy Porgy appear in either the second or third returned document.

This exercise shows how various retrieval methods can be employed to return docu- ments semantically. With this base established, we can see how RAG can be applied to knowledge and memory systems. The following section will discuss RAG as it applies to knowledge of agents and agentic systems.

# 8.5 Applying RAG to building agent knowledge

Knowledge in agents encompasses employing RAG to search semantically across unstructured documents. These documents could be anything from PDFs to Micro- soft Word documents and all text, including code. Agentic knowledge also includes using unstructured documents for Q&A, reference lookup, information augmenta- tion, and other future patterns. Nexus, the agent platform developed in tandem with this book and introduced in the previous chapter, employs complete knowledge and memory systems for agents. In this section, we’ll uncover how the knowledge system works. To install Nexus for just this chapter, see listing 8.9. Open a terminal within the chapter_08 folder, and execute the commands in the listing to download, install, and run Nexus in normal or development mode. If you want to refer to the code, you should install the project in development and configure the debugger to run the Streamlit app from VS Code. Refer to chapter 7 if you need a refresher on any of these steps.

***8.5 Applying RAG to building agent knowledge* 197**
Regardless of which method you decide to run the app in after you log in, navigate to the Knowledge Store Manager page, as shown in figure 8.9. Create a new Knowledge Store, and then upload the sample_documents/back_to_the_future.txt movie script.

**Create a new Select the knowledge store. knowledge store.**

**Drag and drop or browse and select the sample_documents/back_to_the_future.txt**

Figure 8.9 Adding a new knowledge store and populating it with a document

The script is a large document, and it may take a while to load, chunk, and embed the parts into the Chroma DB vector database. Wait for the indexing to complete, and then you can inspect the embeddings and run a query, as shown in figure 8.10. Now, we can connect the knowledge store to a supported agent and ask questions. Use the top-left selector to choose the chat page within the Nexus interface. Then, select an agent and the time_travel knowledge store, as shown in figure 8.11. You will also need to select an agent engine that supports knowledge. Each of the multiple agent engines requires the proper configuration to be accessible. Currently, as of this chapter, Nexus supports access to only a single knowledge store at a time. In a future version, agents may be able to select multiple knowledge stores at a time. This may include more advanced options, from semantic knowl- edge to employing other forms of RAG.

The loading, splitting, chunking, and embedding options provided are the only basic options supported by LangChain for now. In future versions of Nexus, more options and patterns will be offered. The code to support other options can be added directly to Nexus. We won’t cover the code that performs the RAG as it’s very similar to what we already covered. Feel free to review the Nexus code, particularly the KnowledgeManager class in the knowledge_manager.py file.

**200** CHAPTER 8 ***Understanding agent memory and knowledge***

While the retrieval patterns for knowledge and memory are quite similar for aug- mentation, the two patterns differ when it comes to populating the stores. In the next section, we’ll explore what makes memory in agents unique.

# 8.6 Implementing memory in agentic systems

Memory in agents and AI applications is often described in the same terms as cogni- tive memory functions. *Cognitive* memory describes the type of memory we use to remember what we did 30 seconds ago or how tall we were 30 years ago. Computer memory is also an essential element of agent memory, but one we won’t consider in this section.

Figure 8.13 shows how memory is broken down into sensory, short-term, and long-

term memory. This memory can be applied to AI agents, and this list describes how each form of memory maps to agent functions:

- *Sensory memory in AI*—Functions such as RAG but with images/audio/haptic data forms. Briefly holds input data (e.g., text and images) for immediate pro- cessing but not long-term storage.
- *Short-term/working memory in AI*—Acts as an active memory buffer of conversa- tion history. We’re holding a limited amount of recent input and context for immediate analysis and response generation. Within Nexus, short- and long- term conversational memory is also held in the context of the thread.
- *Long-term memory in AI*—Longer-term memory storage relevant to the agent’s or user’s life. Semantic memory provides a robust capacity to store and retrieve rel- evant global or local facts and concepts.

***8.6 Implementing memory in agentic systems* 201**
While memory uses the exact same retrieval and augmentation mechanisms as knowl- edge, it typically differs significantly when updating or appending memories. Figure 8.14 highlights the process of capturing and using memories to augment prompts. Because memories are often different from the size of complete documents, we can avoid using any splitting or chunking mechanisms.

Figure 8.14 Basic memory retrieval and augmentation workflow

Nexus provides a mechanism like the knowledge store, allowing users to create mem- ory stores that can be configured for various uses and applications. It also supports some of the more advanced memory forms highlighted in figure 8.13. The following section will examine how basic memory stores work in Nexus.

<!-- Page 226 -->

**202** CHAPTER 8 ***Understanding agent memory and knowledge***

# 8.6.1 Consuming memory stores in Nexus

Memory stores operate and are constructed like knowledge stores in Nexus. They both heavily rely on the retrieval pattern. What differs is the extra steps memory sys- tems take to build new memories. Go ahead and start Nexus, and refer to listing 8.9 if you need to install it. After logging in, select the Memory page, and create a new memory store, as shown in fig- ure 8.15. Select an agent engine, and then add a few personal facts and preferences about yourself.

**Add a few facts or You will need to select an agent preferences about yourself. engine to process the memory.**

Figure 8.15 Adding memories to a newly created memory store

The reason we need an agent (LLM) was shown in figure 8.14 earlier. When informa- tion is fed into a memory store, it’s generally processed through an LLM using a memory

<!-- Page 227 -->

***8.6 Implementing memory in agentic systems* 203**
function, whose purpose is to process the statements/conversations into semantically relevant information related to the type of memory. Listing 8.10 shows the conversational memory function used to extract information from a conversation into memories. Yes, this is just the header portion of the prompt sent to the LLM, instructing it how to extract information from a conversation.

Listing 8.10 Conversational memory function

Summarize the conversation and create a set of statements that summarize the conversation. Return a JSON object with the following keys: 'summary'. Each key should have a list of statements that are relevant to that category. Return only the JSON object and nothing else.

After you generate a few relevant memories about yourself, return to the Chat area in Nexus, enable the my_memory memory store, and see how well the agent knows you.

Figure 8.16 shows a sample conversation using a different agent engine.

**Ask the agent something relevant to If possible, select a different agent** **the facts you just added to memory. engine that supports memory.**

**Select the memory store.**

Figure 8.16 Conversing with a different agent on the same memory store

This is an example of a basic memory pattern that extracts facts/preferences from conversations and stores them in a vector database as memories. Numerous other implementations of memory follow those displayed earlier in figure 8.13. We’ll imple- ment those in the next section.

<!-- Page 228 -->

**204** CHAPTER 8 ***Understanding agent memory and knowledge***

# 8.6.2 Semantic memory and applications to semantic, episodic, and procedural memory

Psychologists categorize memory into multiple forms, depending on what informa- tion is remembered. Semantic, episodic, and procedural memory all represent differ- ent types of information. *Episodic* memories are about events, *procedural* memories are about the process or steps, and *semantic* represents the meaning and could include feelings or emotions. Other forms of memory (geospatial is another), aren’t described here but could be. Because these memories rely on an additional level of categorization, they also rely on another level of semantic categorization. Some platforms, such as Semantic Kernel (SK), refer to this as *semantic memory*. This can be confusing because semantic categori- zation is also applied to extract episodic and procedural memories.

Figure 8.17 shows the semantic memory categorization process, also sometimes

called semantic memory. The difference between semantic memory and regular mem- ory is the additional step of processing the input semantically and extracting relevant questions that can be used to query the memory-relevant vector database.

Conversations are then fed back into the memory function to create relevant **Semantic memory augmentation** new memories.

Figure 8.17 How semantic memory augmentation works

<!-- Page 229 -->

***8.6 Implementing memory in agentic systems* 205**
The benefit of using semantic augmentation is the increased ability to extract more relevant memories. We can see this in operation by jumping back into Nexus and cre- ating a new semantic memory store.

Figure 8.18 shows how to configure a new memory store using semantic memory.

As of yet, you can’t configure the specific function prompts for memory, augmenta- tion, and summarization. However, it can be useful to read through each of the func- tion prompts to gain a sense of how they work.

**206** CHAPTER 8 ***Understanding agent memory and knowledge***

Now, if you go back and add facts and preferences, they will convert to the semantics of the relevant memory type. Figure 8.19 shows an example of memories being popu- lated for the same set of statements into two different forms of memory. Generally, the statements entered into memory would be more specific to the form of memory.

Figure 8.19 Comparing memories for the same information given two different memory types

Memory and knowledge can significantly assist an agent with various application types. Indeed, a single memory/knowledge store could feed one or multiple agents, allowing

<!-- Page 231 -->

***8.7 Understanding memory and knowledge compression* 207**
for further specialized interpretations of both types of stores. We’ll finish out the chapter by discussing memory/knowledge compression next.

# 8.7 Understanding memory and knowledge compression

Much like our own memory, memory stores can become cluttered with redundant information and numerous unrelated details over time. Internally, our minds deal with memory clutter by compressing or summarizing memories. Our minds remem- ber more significant details over less important ones, and memories accessed more frequently. We can apply similar principles of memory compression to agent memory and other retrieval systems to extract significant details. The principle of compression is similar to semantic augmentation but adds another layer to the preclusters groups of related memories that can collectively be summarized.

Figure 8.20 shows the process of memory/knowledge compression. Memories or

knowledge are first clustered using an algorithm such as k-means. Then, the groups of memories are passed through a compression function, which summarizes and collects the items into more succinct representations.

Figure 8.20 The process of memory and knowledge compression

Nexus provides for both knowledge and memory store compression using k-means optimal clustering. Figure 8.21 shows the compression interface for memory. Within the compression interface, you’ll see the items displayed in 3D and clustered. The size (number of items) of the clusters is shown in the left table. Compressing memories and even knowledge is generally recommended if the number of items in a cluster is large or unbalanced. Each use case for compression may vary depending on the use and application of memories. Generally, though, if an

inspection of the items in a store contains repetitive or duplicate information, it’s a good time for compression. The following is a summary of use cases for applications that would benefit from compression.

THE CASE FOR KNOWLEDGE COMPRESSION Knowledge retrieval and augmentation have also been shown to benefit significantly from compression. Results will vary by use case, but generally, the more verbose the source of knowledge, the more it will benefit from compression. Documents that feature literary prose, such as stories and novels, will benefit more than, say, a base of code. However, if the code is likewise very repetitive, compression could also be shown to be beneficial.

THE CASE FOR HOW OFTEN YOU APPLY COMPRESSION Memory will often benefit from the periodic compression application, whereas knowl- edge stores typically only help on the first load. How frequently you apply compres- sion will greatly depend on the memory use, frequency, and quantity.

THE CASE FOR APPLYING COMPRESSION MORE THAN ONCE Multiple passes of compression at the same time has been shown to improve retrieval performance. Other patterns have also suggested using memory or knowledge at vari- ous levels of compression. For example, a knowledge store is compressed two times, resulting in three different levels of knowledge.

<!-- Page 233 -->

***8.8 Exercises* 209**
THE CASE FOR BLENDING KNOWLEDGE AND MEMORY COMPRESSION If a system is specialized to a particular source of knowledge and that system also employs memories, there may be further optimization to consolidate stores. Another approach is to populate memory with the starting knowledge of a document directly. THE CASE FOR MULTIPLE MEMORY OR KNOWLEDGE STORES In more advanced systems, we’ll look at agents employing multiple memory and knowl- edge stores relevant to their workflow. For example, an agent could employ individual memory stores as part of its conversations with individual users, perhaps including the ability to share different groups of memory with different groups of individuals. Mem- ory and knowledge retrieval are cornerstones of agentic systems, and we can now sum- marize what we covered and review some learning exercises in the next section.

# Mastering agent prompts with prompt flow

## This chapter covers

- Understanding systematic prompt engineering and setting up your first prompt flow
- Crafting an effective profile/persona prompt
- Evaluating profiles: Rubrics and grounding
- Grounding evaluation of a large language model profile
- Comparing prompts: Getting the perfect profile
In this chapter, we delve into the Test Changes Systematically prompt engineering strategy. If you recall, we covered the grand strategies of the OpenAI prompt engi- neering framework in chapter 2. These strategies are instrumental in helping us build better prompts and, consequently, better agent profiles and personas. Under- standing this role is key to our prompt engineering journey. Test Changes Systematically is such a core facet of prompt engineering that Mic- rosoft developed a tool around this strategy called *prompt flow*, described later in this chapter. Before getting to prompt flow, we need to understand why we need systemic prompt engineering.

<!-- Page 237 -->

***9.1 Why we need systematic prompt engineering* 213**
# 9.1 Why we need systematic prompt engineering

Prompt engineering, by its nature, is an iterative process. When building a prompt, you’ll often iterate and evaluate. To see this concept in action, consider the simple application of prompt engineering to a ChatGPT question. You can follow along by opening your browser to ChatGPT ([https://chat.openai](https://chat.openai) .com/), entering the following (text) prompt into ChatGPT, and clicking the Send Mes- sage button (an example of this conversation is shown in figure 9.1, on the left side):

## can you recommend something

**Details are included in the prompt/request.**

**No prompt engineering Applying prompt engineering**

**ChatGPT guides the user to supply additional details.**

Figure 9.1 The differences in applying prompt engineering and iterating

We can see that the response from ChatGPT is asking for more information. Go ahead and open a new conversation with ChatGPT, and enter the following prompt, as shown in figure 9.1, on the right side:

Can you please recommend a time travel movie set in the medieval period.

The results in figure 9.1 show a clear difference between leaving out details and being more specific in your request. We just applied the tactic of politely Writing Clear Instruc- tions, and ChatGPT provided us with a good recommendation. But also notice how ChatGPT itself guides the user into better prompting. The refreshed screen shown in

figure 9.2 shows the OpenAI prompt engineering strategies.

We just applied simple iteration to improve our prompt. We can extend this exam- ple by using a system prompt/message. Figure 9.3 demonstrates the use and role of the system prompt in iterative communication. In chapter 2, we used the system mes- sage/prompt in various examples.

ChatGPT will respond with some pleasant comments, as shown in figure 9.4. Because of this, it’s happy to accept its new role and asks for any follow-up questions. Now enter the following generic prompt as we did previously: can you recommend something

**216** CHAPTER 9 ***Mastering agent prompts with prompt flow***

We’ve just seen the iteration of refining a prompt, the prompt engineering, to extract a better response. This was accomplished over three different conversations using the ChatGPT UI. While not the most efficient way, it works. However, we haven’t defined the iterative flow for evaluating the prompt and determining when a prompt is effective. Figure 9.5 shows a systemic method of prompt engineering using a system of iteration and evaluation.

The system of iterating and evaluating prompts covers the broad Test Changes System- ically strategy. Evaluating the performance and effectiveness of prompts is still new, but we’ll use techniques from education, such as rubrics and grounding, which we’ll explore in a later section of this chapter. However, as spelled out in the next section, we need to understand the difference between a persona and an agent profile before we do so.

# 9.2 Understanding agent profiles and personas

An *agent profile* is an encapsulation of component prompts or messages that describe an agent. It includes the agent’s persona, special instructions, and other strategies that can guide the user or other agent consumers.

Figure 9.6 shows the main elements of an agent profile. These elements map to

prompt engineering strategies described in this book. Not all agents will use all the elements of a full agent profile. At a basic level, an *agent profile* is a set of prompts describing the agent. It may include other external elements related to actions/tools, knowledge, memory,

reasoning, evaluation, planning, and feedback. The combination of these elements comprises an entire agent prompt profile. Prompts are the heart of an agent’s function. A prompt or set of prompts drives each of the agent components in the profile. For actions/tools, these prompts are well defined, but as we’ve seen, prompts for memory and knowledge can vary significantly by use case. The definition of an AI agent profile is more than just a system prompt. Prompt flow can allow us to construct the prompts and code comprising the agent profile but also include the ability to evaluate its effectiveness. In the next section, we’ll open up prompt flow and start using it.

# 9.3 Setting up your first prompt flow

Prompt flow is a tool developed by Microsoft within its Azure Machine Learning Stu- dio platform. The tool was later released as an open source project on GitHub, where it has attracted more attention and use. While initially intended as an applica- tion platform, it has since shown its strength in developing and evaluating prompts/ profiles. Because prompt flow was initially developed to run on Azure as a service, it fea- tures a robust core architecture. The tool supports multi-threaded batch processing,

<!-- Page 242 -->

**218** CHAPTER 9 ***Mastering agent prompts with prompt flow***

which makes it ideal for evaluating prompts at scale. The following section will exam- ine the basics of starting with prompt flow.

# 9.3.1 Getting started

There are a few prerequisites to undertake before working through the exercises in this book. The relevant prerequisites for this section and chapter are shown in the fol- lowing list; make sure to complete them before attempting the exercises:

- *Visual Studio Code (VS Code)*—Refer to appendix A for installation instructions, including additional extensions.
- *Prompt flow, VS Code extension*—Refer to appendix A for details on installing extensions.
- *Python virtual environment*—Refer to appendix A for details on setting up a vir- tual environment.
- *Install prompt flow packages*—Within your virtual environment, do a quick pip install, as shown here: pip install promptflow promptflow-tools
- *LLM (GPT-4 or above)*—You’ll need access to GPT-4 or above through OpenAI or Azure OpenAI Studio. Refer to appendix B if you need assistance accessing these resources.
- *Book’s source code*—Clone the book’s source code to a local folder; refer to appendix A if you need help cloning the repository.
Open up VS Code to the book’s source code folder, chapter 3. Ensure that you have a virtual environment connected and have installed the prompt flow packages and extension. First, you’ll want to create a connection to your LLM resource within the prompt flow extension. Open the prompt flow extension within VS Code, and then click to open the connections. Then, click the plus sign beside the LLM resource to create a new connection, as shown in figure 9.7. This will open a YAML file where you’ll need to populate the connection name and other information relevant to your connection. Follow the directions, and don’t enter API keys into the document, as shown in figure 9.8. When the connection information is entered, click the Create Connection link at the bottom of the document. This will open a terminal prompt below the document, asking you to enter your key. Depending on your terminal configuration, you may be unable to paste (Ctrl-V, Cmd-V). Alternatively, you can paste the key by hovering the mouse cursor over the terminal and right-clicking on Windows. We’ll now test the connection by first opening the simple flow in the chap- ter_09/promptflow/simpleflow folder. Then, open the flow.dag.yaml file in VS Code. This is a YAML file, but the prompt flow extension provides a visual editor

<!-- Page 245 -->

***9.3 Setting up your first prompt flow* 221**
A prompt flow is composed of a set of blocks starting with an Inputs block and termi- nating in an Outputs block. Within this simple flow, the recommender block represents the LLM connection and the prompt used to converse with the model. The echo block for this simple example echoes the input. When creating a connection to an LLM, either in prompt flow or through an API, here are the crucial parameters we always need to consider (prompt flow docu- mentation: [https://microsoft.github.io/promptflow](https://microsoft.github.io/promptflow)):

- *Connection*—This is the connection name, but it also represents the service you’re connecting to. Prompt flow supports multiple services, including locally deployed LLMs.
- *API*—This is the API type. The options are chat for a chat completion API, such as GPT-4, or completion for the older completion models, such as the OpenAI Davinci.
- *Model*—This may be the model or deployment name, depending on your service connection. For OpenAI, this will be the model’s name, and for Azure OpenAI, it will represent the deployment name.
- *Temperature*—This represents the stochasticity or variability of the model response. A value of 1 represents a high variability of responses, while 0 indicates a desire for no variability. This is a critical parameter to understand and, as we’ll see, will vary by use case.
- *Stop*—This optional setting tells the call to the LLM to stop creating tokens. It’s more appropriate for older and open source models.
- *Max tokens*—This limits the number of tokens used in a conversation. Knowl- edge of how many tokens you use is crucial to evaluating how your LLM interac- tions will work when scaled. Counting tokens may not be a concern if you’re exploring and conducting research. However, in production systems, tokens represent the load on the LLM, and connections using numerous tokens may not scale well.
- *Advanced parameters*—You can set a few more options to tune your interaction with the LLM, but we’ll cover that topic in later sections of the book.
After configuring the LLM block, scroll up to the Inputs block section, and review the primary input shown in the user_input field, as shown in figure 9.11. Leave it as the default, and then click the Play button at the top of the window. All the blocks in the flow will run, and the results will be shown in the terminal win- dow. What you should find interesting is that the output shows recommendations for time travel movies. This is because the recommender block already has a simple pro- file set, and we’ll see how that works in the next section.

# 9.3.2 Creating profiles with Jinja2 templates

The flow responds with time travel movie recommendations because of the prompt or profile it uses. By default, prompt flow uses Jinja2 templates to define the content of the prompt or what we’ll call a *profile.* For the purposes of this book and our explora- tion of AI agents, we’ll refer to these templates as the profile of a flow or agent. While prompt flow doesn’t explicitly refer to itself as an assistant or agent engine, it certainly meets the criteria of producing a proxy and general types of agents. As you’ll see, prompt flow even supports deployments of flows into containers and as services. Open VS Code to chapter_09/promptflow/simpleflow/flow.dag.yaml, and open the file in the visual editor. Then, locate the Prompt field, and click the recommended .jinja2 link, as shown in figure 9.12.

**Click the link to open Defines the start of the system and the inja2 template.J user portion of the prompt/profile**

***9.3 Setting up your first prompt flow* 223**
Jinja is a templating engine, and Jinja2 is a particular version of that engine. Tem- plates are an excellent way of defining the layout and parts of any form of text docu- ment. They have been extensively used to produce HTML, JSON, CSS, and other document forms. In addition, they support the ability to apply code directly into the template. While there is no standard way to construct prompts or agent profiles, our preference in this book is to use templating engines such as Jinja. At this point, change the role within the system prompt of the recommended.jin- ja2 template. Then, run all blocks of the flow by opening the flow in the visual editor and clicking the Play button. The next section will look at other ways of running prompt flow for testing or actual deployment.

# 9.3.3 Deploying a prompt flow API

Because prompt flow was also designed to be deployed as a service, it supports a cou- ple of ways to deploy as an app or API quickly. Prompt flow can be deployed as a local web application and API running from the terminal or as a Docker container. Return to the flow.dag.yaml file in the visual editor from VS Code. At the top of the window beside the Play button are several options we’ll want to investigate further. Click the Build button as shown in figure 9.13, and then select to deploy as a local app. A new YAML file will be created to configure the app. Leave the defaults, and click the Start Local App link.

**Click the Build button. When prompted, select to build as either a web application or Docker container.**

**Click the link to start the local app.**

Figure 9.13 Building and starting the flow as a local app

This will launch the flow as a local web application, and you’ll see a browser tab open, as shown in figure 9.14. Enter some text into the user_input field, which is marked as required with a red asterisk. Click Enter and wait a few seconds for the reply. You should see a reply like the one shown earlier in figure 9.12, where the flow or agent replies with a list of time travel movies. This is great—we’ve just developed our first agent profile and the equivalent of a proxy agent. However, we need to determine

how successful or valuable the recommendations are. In the next section, we explore how to evaluate prompts and profiles.

# 9.4 Evaluating profiles: Rubrics and grounding

A key element of any prompt or agent profile is how well it performs its given task. As we see in our recommendation example, prompting an agent profile to give a list of recommendations is relatively easy, but knowing whether those recommendations are helpful requires us to evaluate the response. Fortunately, prompt flow has been designed to evaluate prompts/profiles at scale. The robust infrastructure allows for the evaluation of LLM interactions to be paral- lelized and managed as workers, allowing hundreds of profile evaluations and varia- tions to happen quickly. In the next section, we look at how prompt flow can be configured to run prompt/ profile variations against each other. We’ll need to understand this before evaluating profiles’ performance. Prompt flow provides a mechanism to allow for multiple variations within an LLM prompt/profile. This tool is excellent for comparing subtle or significant differences

<!-- Page 249 -->

***9.4 Evaluating profiles: Rubrics and grounding* 225**
between profile variations. When used in performing bulk evaluations, it can be invaluable for quickly assessing the performance of a profile. Open the recommender_with_variations/flow.dag.yaml file in VS Code and the flow visual editor, as shown in figure 9.15. This time, we’re making the profile more generalized and allowing for customization at the input level. This allows us to expand our recommendations to anything and not just time travel movies.

**Added additional inputs into the recommender**

**The recommenderLLM has two variations. Click the adjust icons to see and edit the variations.**

**Inputs are passed directly to the recommender LLM block.**

Figure 9.15 The recommender, with variations in flow and expanded inputs

The new inputs Subject, Genre, Format, and Custom allow us to define a profile that can easily be adjusted to any recommendation. This also means that we must prime the inputs based on the recommendation use case. There are multiple ways to prime these inputs; two examples of priming inputs are shown in figure 9.16. The figure shows two options, options A and B, for priming inputs. Option A represents the clas- sic UI; perhaps there are objects for the user to select the subject or genre, for exam- ple. Option B places a proxy/chat agent to interact with the user better to understand the desired subject, genre, and so on.

<!-- Page 250 -->

**identifies the subject, genre, format, and custom through conversation.**

Figure 9.16 The user interaction options for interfacing with the agent profile to prime inputs to the agent profile

Even considering the power of LLMs, you may still want or need to use option A. The benefit of option A is that you can constrain and validate the inputs much like you do with any modern UI. Alternatively, the downside of option A is that the constrained behavior may limit and restrict future use cases. Option B represents a more fluid and natural way without a traditional UI. It’s far more powerful and extensible than option A but also introduces more unknowns for evaluation. However, if the proxy agent that option B uses is written well, it can assist a lot in gathering better information from the user. The option you choose will dictate how you need to evaluate your profiles. If you’re okay with a constrained UI, then it’s likely that the inputs will also be con- strained to a set of discrete values. For now, we’ll assume option B for input priming, meaning the input values will be defined by their name. To get back to VS Code and the visual view of the recommender with variants flow, click the icon shown earlier in figure 9.15 to open the variants and allow editing. Then, click the recommend.jinja2 and recommender_variant_1.jinja2 links to open the files side by side, as shown in figure 9.17.

Figure 9.17 demonstrates the difference between the variant profiles. One profile

injects the inputs into the user prompt, and the other injects them into the system prompt. However, it’s essential to understand that variations can encompass more than profile design, as identified in table 9.1.

Notes

Some endless combinations and tech- niques can be applied here. Prompt engi- neering is evolving all the time.

This is a useful way to evaluate and ground model performance against a prompt. It can also help you tune your profile to work with open source and/or cheaper models.

Changes to the temperature can signifi- cantly change the responses of some prompts, which may improve or degrade performance.

This can allow you to reduce and maxi- mize token usage.

We’ll cover the use of these advanced parameters in later chapters.

Function calls will be addressed later in this chapter.

For this simple example, we’re just going to use prompt variations by varying the input to reflect in either the system or user prompt. Refer to figure 9.17 for what this looks

**#2 Select the option to run all variations.**

**#1 Click Play (Run All) to start the run.**

Figure 9.18 Running both prompt variations at the same time

In the terminal window, you’ll see the results of both runs. The results will likely look similar, so now we must move on to how we evaluate the difference between variations in the next section.

# 9.5 Understanding rubrics and grounding

Evaluation of prompt/profile performance isn’t something we can typically do using a measure of accuracy or correct percentage. Measuring the performance of a profile depends on the use case and desired outcome. If that is as simple as determining if the response was right or wrong, all the better. However, in most cases, evaluation won’t be that simple. In education, the *rubric* concept defines a structured set of criteria and standards a student must establish to receive a particular grade. A rubric can also be used to define a guide for the performance of a profile or prompt. We can follow these steps to define a rubric we can use to evaluate the performance of a profile or prompt:

1 *Identify the purpose and objectives.* Determine the goals you want the profile or agent to accomplish. For example, do you want to evaluate the quality of recom- mendations for a given audience or overall quality for a given subject, format, or other input? 2 *Define criteria.* Develop a set of criteria or dimensions that you’ll use to evaluate the profile. These criteria should align with your objectives and provide clear guidelines for assessment. Each criterion should be specific and measurable.

<!-- Page 253 -->

***9.5 Understanding rubrics and grounding* 229**
For example, you may want to measure a recommendation by how well it fits with the genre and then by subject and format. 3 *Create a scale*. Establish a rating scale that describes the levels of performance for each criterion. Standard scales include numerical scales (e.g., 1–5) or descrip- tive scales (e.g., Excellent, Good, Fair, Poor). 4 *Provide descriptions.* For each level on the scale, provide clear and concise descrip- tions that indicate what constitutes a strong performance and what represents a weaker performance for each criterion. 5 *Apply the rubric.* When assessing a prompt or profile, use the rubric to evaluate the prompt’s performance based on the established criteria. Assign scores or ratings for each criterion, considering the descriptions for each level. 6 *Calculate the total score.* Depending on your rubric, you may calculate a total score by summing up the scores for each criterion or using a weighted average if some criteria are more important than others. 7 *Ensure evaluation consistency.* If multiple evaluators are assessing the profile, it’s crucial to ensure consistency in grading. 8 *Review, revise, and iterate.* Periodically review and revise the rubric to ensure it aligns with your assessment goals and objectives. Adjust as needed to improve its effectiveness.

*Grounding* is a concept that can be applied to profile and prompt evaluation—it defines how well a response is aligned with a given rubric’s specific criteria and stan- dards. You can also think of grounding as the baseline expectation of a prompt or pro- file output. This list summarizes some other important considerations when using grounding with profile evaluation:

- Grounding refers to aligning responses with the criteria, objectives, and context defined by the rubric and prompt.
- Grounding involves assessing whether the response directly addresses the rubric criteria, stays on topic, and adheres to any provided instructions.
- Evaluators and evaluations gauge the accuracy, relevance, and adherence to standards when assessing grounding.
- Grounding ensures that the response output is firmly rooted in the specified context, making the assessment process more objective and meaningful.
A well-grounded response aligns with all the rubric criteria within the given context and objectives. Poorly grounded responses will fail or miss the entire criteria, context, and objectives. As the concepts of rubrics and grounding may still be abstract, let’s look at apply- ing them to our current recommender example. Following is a list that follows the process for defining a rubric as applied to our recommender example:

<!-- Page 254 -->

**230** CHAPTER 9 ***Mastering agent prompts with prompt flow***

1 *Identify the purpose and objectives.* The purpose of our profile/prompt is to recom- mend three top items given a subject, format, genre, and custom input. 2 *Define criteria.* For simplicity, we’ll evaluate how a particular recommendation aligns with the given input criteria, subject, format, and genre. For example, if a profile recommends a book when asked for a movie format, we expect a low score in the format criteria. 3 *Create a scale.* Again, keeping things simple, we’ll use a scale of 1–5 (1 is poor, and 5 is excellent). 4 *Provide descriptions.* See the general descriptions for the rating scale shown in

table 9.2.

5 *Apply the rubric.* With the rubric assigned at this stage, it’s an excellent exercise to evaluate the rubric against recommendations manually. 6 *Calculate the total score.* For our rubric, we’ll average the score for all criteria to provide a total score. 7 *Ensure evaluation consistency.* The technique we’ll use for evaluation will provide very consistent results. 8 *Review, revise, and iterate.* We’ll review, compare, and iterate on our profiles, rubrics, and the evaluations themselves.

Table 9.2 Rubric ratings

Rating Description

1 Poor alignment: this is the opposite of what is expected given the criteria. 2 Bad alignment: this isn’t a good fit for the given criteria. 3 Mediocre alignment: it may or may not fit well with the given criteria. 4 Good alignment: it may not align 100% with the criteria but is a good fit otherwise. 5 Excellent alignment: this is a good recommendation for the given criteria.

This basic rubric can now be applied to evaluate the responses for our profile. You can do this manually, or as you’ll see in the next section, using a second LLM profile.

# 9.6 Grounding evaluation with an LLM profile

This section will employ another LLM prompt/profile for evaluation and grounding. This second LLM prompt will add another block after the recommendations are gen- erated. It will process the generated recommendations and evaluate each one, given the previous rubric. Before GPT-4 and other sophisticated LLMs came along, we would have never con- sidered using another LLM prompt to evaluate or ground a profile. You often want

<!-- Page 255 -->

***9.6 Grounding evaluation with an LLM profile* 231**
to use a different model when using LLMs to ground a profile. However, if you’re comparing profiles against each other, using the same LLM for evaluation and ground- ing is appropriate. Open the recommender_with_LLM_evaluation\flow.dag.yaml file in the prompt flow visual editor, scroll down to the evaluate_recommendation block, and click the evaluate_recommendation.jinja2 link to open the file, as shown in figure 9.19. Each section of the rubric is identified in the figure.

**Define the basic role of the profile.**

**Define the basic criteria for the rubric.**

**Define the rubric scale and a description for each item**

**on the scale.**

**Reiterate the criteria and scale, and show an example of expected output.**

Figure 9.19 The evaluation prompt, with each of the parts of the rubric outlined

We have a rubric that is not only well defined but also in the form of a prompt that can be used to evaluate recommendations. This allows us to evaluate the effectiveness of recommendations for a given profile—automatically. Of course, you can also use the rubric to score and evaluate the recommendations manually for a better baseline.

NOTE Using LLMs to evaluate prompts and profiles provides a strong base- line for comparing the performance of a profile. It can also do this without human bias in a controlled and repeatable manner. This provides an excel- lent mechanism to establish baseline groundings for any profile or prompt.

Returning to the recommender_with_LLM_evaluation flow visual editor, we can run the flow by clicking the Play button and observing the output. You can run a single

<!-- Page 256 -->

**232** CHAPTER 9 ***Mastering agent prompts with prompt flow***

recommendation or run both variations when prompted. The output of a single eval- uation using the default inputs is shown in the following listing.

Listing 9.1 LLM rubric evaluation output

{ "recommendations": "Title: The Butterfly Effect Subject: 5 Format: 5 Genre: 4

Title: Primer Subject: 5 Format: 5 Genre: 4

Title: Time Bandits Subject: 5 Format: 5 Genre: 5" }

We now have a rubric for grounding our recommender, and the evaluation is run automatically using a second LLM prompt. In the next section, we look at how to per- form multiple evaluations simultaneously and then at a total score for everything.

# 9.7 Comparing profiles: Getting the perfect profile

With our understanding of rubrics and grounding, we can now move on to evaluating and iterating the perfect profile. Before we do that, though, we need to clean up the output from the LLM evaluation block. This will require us to parse the recommenda- tions into something more Pythonic, which we’ll tackle in the next section.

## 9.7.1 Parsing the LLM evaluation output

As the raw output from the evaluation block is text, we now want to parse that into something more usable. Of course, writing parsing functions is simple, but there are better ways to cast responses automagically. We covered better methods for returning responses in chapter 5, on agent actions. Open chapter_09\prompt_flow\recommender_with_parsing\flow.dag.yaml in VS Code, and look at the flow in the visual editor. Locate the parsing_results block, and click the link to open the Python file in the editor, as shown in figure 9.20. The code for the parsing_results.py file is shown in listing 9.2.

## Before parsing:

"Title: The Butterfly Effect Subject: 5 Format: 5 Genre: 4

Title: Primer Subject: 5 Format: 5 Genre: 4

Title: Time Bandits Subject: 5 Format: 5 Genre: 5"

## After parsing:

{ "title": " The Butterfly Effect "subject": "5", "format": "5", "genre": "4" }, { "title": " Primer", "subject": "5", "format": "5", "genre": "4" }, { "title": " Time Bandits", "subject": "5", "format": "5", "genre": "5" }

The output of this parsing_results block now gets passed to the output and is wrapped in a list of recommendations. We can see what all this looks like by running the flow. Open flow.dag.yaml for the flow in the visual editor, and click the Play (Run All) button. Be sure to select to use both recommender variants. You’ll see both variations run and output to the terminal. At this point, we have a full working recommendation and LLM evaluation flow that outputs a score for each criterion on each output. However, to do comprehensive evaluations of a particular profile, we want to generate multiple recommendations with various criteria. We’ll see how to do batch processing of flows in the next section.

<!-- Page 259 -->

***9.7 Comparing profiles: Getting the perfect profile* 235**
# 9.7.2 Running batch processing in prompt flow

In our generic recommendation profile, we want to evaluate how various input crite- ria can affect the generated recommendations. Fortunately, prompt flow can batch- process any variations we want to test. The limit is only the time and money we want to spend. To perform batch processing, we must first create a JSON Lines (JSONL) or JSON list document of our input criteria. If you recall, our input criteria looked like the fol- lowing in JSON format:

{ "**subject**": "time travel", "**format**": "books", "**genre**": "fantasy", "**custom**": "don't include any R rated content" }

We want to create a list of JSON objects like that just shown, preferably in a random manner. Of course, the simple way to do this is to prompt ChatGPT to create a JSONL document using the following prompt:

I am developing a recommendation agent. The agent will recommend anything given the following criteria:

1. subject-examples: time travel, cooking, vacation
2. format-examples: books, movies, games
3. genre: documentary, action, romance
4. custom: don't include any R rated content Can you please generate a random list of these criteria and output it in the format of a JSON Lines file, JSONL. Please include 10 items in the list.
Try this out by going to ChatGPT and entering the preceding prompt. A previously generated file can be found in the flow folder, called \bulk_recommend.jsonl. The contents of this file have been shown here for reference:

{ "subject": "time travel", "format": "books", "genre": "fantasy", "custom": "don't include any R rated content" } { "subject": "space exploration", "format": "podcasts", "genre": "sci-fi", "custom": "include family-friendly content only" }

<!-- Page 260 -->

**236** CHAPTER 9 ***Mastering agent prompts with prompt flow***

{ "subject": "mystery", "format": "podcasts", "genre": "fantasy", "custom": "don't include any R rated content" } { "subject": "space exploration", "format": "podcasts", "genre": "action", "custom": "include family-friendly content only" } { "subject": "vacation", "format": "books", "genre": "thriller", "custom": "don't include any R rated content" } { "subject": "mystery", "format": "books", "genre": "sci-fi", "custom": "don't include any R rated content" } { "subject": "mystery", "format": "books", "genre": "romance", "custom": "don't include any R rated content" } { "subject": "vacation", "format": "movies", "genre": "fantasy", "custom": "don't include any R rated content" } { "subject": "cooking", "format": "TV shows", "genre": "thriller", "custom": "include family-friendly content only" } { "subject": "mystery", "format": "movies", "genre": "romance", "custom": "include family-friendly content only" }

With this bulk file, we can run both variants using the various input criteria in the bulk JSONL file. Open the flow.dag.yaml file in the visual editor, click Batch (the beaker icon) to start the bulk-data loading process, and select the file as shown in figure 9.21. For some operating systems, this may appear as Local Data File.

<!-- Page 261 -->

**Select a local file.**

**Click to open the select input source.**

Figure 9.21 Loading the bulk JSONL file to run the flow on multiple input variations

After the bulk file is selected, a new YAML document will open with a Run link added at the bottom of the file, as shown in figure 9.22. Click the link to do the batch run of inputs.

**Click to run the batch.**

Figure 9.22 Running the batch run of inputs

At this point, a few things will happen. The flow visual editor will appear, and beside that a log file will open, showing the progress of the run. In the terminal window, you’ll see the various worker processes spawning and running. Be patient. The batch run, even for 10 items, may take a few minutes or seconds, depending on various factors such as hardware, previous calls, and so on. Wait for the run to complete, and you’ll see a summary of results in the terminal. You can also view the run results by opening the prompt flow extension and select- ing the last run, as shown in figure 9.23. Then, you dig into each run by clicking the

A lot of information is captured during a batch run, and you can explore much of it through the visualizer. More information can be found by clicking the output folder link from the terminal window. This will open another session of VS Code with the output folder allowing you to review the run logs and other details. Now that we’ve completed the batch run for each variant, we can apply grounding and evaluate the results of both prompts. The next section will use a new flow to per- form the profile/prompt evaluation.

# 9.7.3 Creating an evaluation flow for grounding

Open chapter_3\prompt_flow\evaluate_groundings\flow.dag.yaml in the visual edi- tor, as shown in figure 9.24. There are no LLM blocks in the evaluation flow—just Python code blocks that will run the scoring and then aggregate the scores. We can now look at the code for the scoring and aggregate blocks, starting with the scoring code in listing 9.3. This scoring code averages the score for each criterion into an average score. The output of the function is a list of processed recommendations.

<!-- Page 263 -->

***9.7 Comparing profiles: Getting the perfect profile* 239**
**line_process block processes and scores each recommendation.**

**aggregate block aggregates the results of scoring.**

Figure 9.24 Looking at the **evaluate_groundings** flow used to ground recommendation runs

Listing 9.3 **line_process.py**

@tool def line_process(recommendations: str): **A set of three recommendations** inputs = recommendations **is input into the function.** output = [] for data_dict in inputs: total_score = 0 **Loops over each** score_count = 0 **recommendation** **and criterion** for key, value in data_dict.items(): if key != "title": **Title isn’t a criterion,** try: **so ignore it.** total_score += float(value) score_count += 1 **Totals the score** data_dict[key] = float(value) **for all criteria** except: **and sets the float** pass **value to key**

avg_score = total_score / score_count if score_count > 0 else 0

data_dict["avg_score"] = round(avg_score, 2) **Adds the average** output.append(data_dict) **score as a grounding** **score of the** return output **recommendation**

<!-- Page 264 -->

**240** CHAPTER 9 ***Mastering agent prompts with prompt flow***

From the grounded recommendations, we can move on to aggregating the scores with the aggregate block—the code for the aggregate block is shown in the follow- ing listing.

Listing 9.4 **aggregate.py**

@tool def aggregate(processed_results: List[str]): items = [item for sublist in processed_results ➥ for item in sublist] **The input is a list of lists; flatten to** aggregated = {} **a list of items.** for item in items: for key, value in item.items(): if key == 'title': continue **Checks to see if the value** **is numeric and accumulates scores for each criterion key** if isinstance(value, (float, int)): if key in aggregated: aggregated[key] += value else: aggregated[key] = value **Loops over aggregated criterion scores** for key, value in aggregated.items(): value = value / len(items) log_metric(key=key, value=value) **Logs the criterion** aggregated[key] = value **as a metric** return aggregated

The result of the aggregations will be a summary score for each criterion and the aver- age score. Since the evaluation/grounding flow is separate, it can be run over any rec- ommendation run we perform. This will allow us to use the batch run results for any variation to compare results. We can run the grounding flow by opening flow.dag.yaml in the visual editor and clicking Batch (beaker icon). Then, when prompted, we select an existing run and then select the run we want to evaluate, as shown in figure 9.25. This will open a YAML file with the Run link at the bottom, as we’ve seen before. Click the Run link to run the evaluation. After the run is completed, you’ll see a summary of the results in the terminal win- dow. You can click the output link to open the folder in VS Code and analyze the results, but there is a better way to compare them. Open the prompt flow extension, focus on the Batch Run History window, and scroll down to the Run against Run section, as shown in figure 9.26. Select the runs you want to compare—likely the ones near the top—so that the checkmark appears. Then, right-click the run, and select the Visualize Runs option. The Batch Run Visual- ization window opens, and you’ll see the metrics for each of the runs at the top.

We can now see a significant difference between profile/prompt variation 0, the user prompt, and variation 1, the system prompt. Refer to figure 9.15 if you need a refresher on what the prompts/profiles look like. At this point, it should be evi- dent that injecting the input parameters into the system prompt provides better recommendations. You can now go back and try other profiles or other variant options to see what effect this has on your recommendations. The possibilities are virtually endless, but hopefully you can see what an excellent tool prompt flow will be for building agent profiles and prompts.

# Summary

- An agent profile consists of several other component prompts that can drive functions such as actions/tools, knowledge, memory, evaluation, reasoning, feed- back, and planning.
- Prompt flow can be used to evaluate an agent’s component prompts.
- Systemic prompt engineering is an iterative process evaluating a prompt and agent profile.
- The Test Changes Systematically strategy describes iterating and evaluating prompts, and system prompt engineering implements this strategy.
- Agent profiles and prompt engineering have many similarities. We define an agent profile as the combination of prompt engineering elements that guide and help an agent through its task.
- Prompt flow is an open source tool from Microsoft that provides several fea- tures for developing and evaluating profiles and prompts.
- An LLM connection in prompt flow supports additional parameters, including temperature, stop token, max tokens, and other advanced parameters.
- LLM blocks support prompt and profile variants, which allow for evaluating changes to the prompt/profile or other connection parameters.
- A rubric applied to an LLM prompt is the criteria and standards a prompt/profile must fulfill to be grounded. Grounding is the scoring and evaluation of a rubric.
- Prompt flow supports running multiple variations as single runs or batch runs.
- In prompt flow, an evaluation flow is run after a generative flow to score and aggregate the results. The Visualize Runs option can compare the aggregated criteria from scoring the rubric across multiple runs.

# Agent reasoning and evaluation

## This chapter covers

- Using various prompt engineering techniques to extend large language model functions
- Engaging large language models with prompt engineering techniques that engage reasoning
- Employing an evaluation prompt to narrow and identify the solution to an unknown problem
Now that we’ve examined the patterns of memory and retrieval that define the semantic memory component in agents, we can take a look at the last and most instrumental component in agents: planning. Planning encompasses many facets, from reasoning, understanding, and evaluation to feedback. To explore how LLMs can be prompted to reason, understand, and plan, we’ll demonstrate how to engage reasoning through prompt engineering and then expand that to planning. The planning solution provided by the Semantic Kernel (SK) encompasses multiple planning forms. We’ll finish the chapter by incorporat- ing adaptive feedback into a new planner.

Figure 10.1 demonstrates the high-level prompt engineering strategies we’ll

cover in this chapter and how they relate to the various techniques we’ll cover. Each

# 10.1 Understanding direct solution prompting

*Direct solution prompting* is generally the first form of prompt engineering that users employ when asking LLMs questions or solving a particular problem. Given any LLM use, these techniques may seem apparent, but they are worth reviewing to establish the foundation of thought and planning. In the next section, we’ll start from the beginning, asking questions and expecting answers.

<!-- Page 270 -->

**246** CHAPTER 10 ***Agent reasoning and evaluation***

# 10.1.1 Question-and-answer prompting

For the exercises in this chapter, we’ll employ prompt flow to build and evaluate the var- ious techniques. (We already extensively covered this tool in chapter 9, so refer to that chapter if you need a review.) Prompt flow is an excellent tool for understanding how these techniques work and exploring the flow of the planning and reasoning process. Open Visual Studio Code (VS Code) to the chapter 10 source folder. Create a new virtual environment for the folder, and install the requirements.txt file. If you need help setting up a chapter’s Python environment, refer to appendix B. We’ll look at the first flow in the prompt_flow/question-answering-prompting folder. Open the flow.dag.yaml file in the visual editor, as shown in figure 10.2. On the right side, you’ll see the flow of components. At the top is the question_answer LLM prompt, followed by two Embedding components and a final LLM prompt to do the evaluation called evaluate.

**Open the flow.dag.yaml file in the visual editor.**

Figure 10.2 The **flow.dag.yaml** file, open in the visual editor, highlighting the various components of the flow

The breakdown in listing 10.1 shows the structure and components of the flow in more detail using a sort of YAML-shortened pseudocode. You can also see the input and outputs to the various components and a sample output from running the flow.

Listing 10.1 **question-answer-prompting** flow

Inputs: context  : the content to ask the question about

<!-- Page 271 -->

***10.1 Understanding direct solution prompting* 247**
question : question asked specific to the content expected : the expected answer

LLM: Question-Answer (the prompt used to ask the question) inputs: context and question outputs: the prediction/answer to the question

Embeddings: uses an LLM embedding model to create the embedding representation of the text

Embedding_predicted: embeds the output of the Question-Answer LLM Embedding_expected: embeds the output of the expected answer

Python: Evaluation (Python code to measure embedding similarity) Inputs: Embedding_predicted output Embedding_expected output Outputs: the similarity score between predicted and expected

Outputs: context: -> input.context question: -> input.question expected: -> input.expected predicted: -> output.question_answer evaluation_score: output.evaluation

### Example Output { "context": "Back to the Future (1985)…", "evaluation_score": 0.9567478002354606, "expected": "Marty traveled back in time 30 years.", "predicted": "Marty traveled back in time 30 years from 1985 to 1955 in the movie \"Back to the Future.\"", "question": "How far did Marty travel back in time in the movie Back to the Future (1985)" }

Before running this flow, make sure your LLM block is configured correctly. This may require you to set up a connection to your chosen LLM. Again, refer to chapter 9 if you need a review on how to complete this. You’ll need to configure the LLM and Embedding blocks with your connection if you’re not using OpenAI. After configuring your LLM connection, run the flow by clicking the Play but- ton from the visual editor or using the Test (Shift-F5) link in the YAML editor win- dow. If everything is connected and configured correctly, you should see output like that in listing 10.1. Open the question_answer.jinja2 file in VS Code, as shown in listing 10.2. This listing shows the basic question-and-answer-style prompt. In this style of prompt, the system message describes the basic rules and provides the context to answer the question.

<!-- Page 272 -->

**248** CHAPTER 10 ***Agent reasoning and evaluation***

In chapter 4, we explored the retrieval augmented generation (RAG) pattern, and this prompt follows a similar pattern.

Listing 10.2 **question_answer.jinja2**

system: Answer the users question based on the context below. Keep the answer short and concise. Respond "Unsure about answer" if not sure about the answer. **Replace with the content LLM** Context: {{context}} **should answer the question about.**

user: **Replace with** Question: {{question}} **the question.**

This exercise shows the simple method of using an LLM to ask questions about a piece of content. Then, the question response is evaluated using a similarity matching score. We can see from the output in listing 10.1 that the LLM does a good job of answering a question about the context. In the next section, we’ll explore a similar technique that uses direct prompting.

# 10.1.2 Implementing few-shot prompting

*Few-shot prompting* is like question-and-answer prompting, but the makeup of the prompt is more about providing a few examples than about facts or context. This allows the LLM to bend to patterns or content not previously seen. While this approach sounds like question and answer, the implementation is quite different, and the results can be powerful.

Zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot learning One holy grail of machine learning and AI is the ability to train a model on as few items as possible. For example, in traditional vision models, millions of images are fed into the model to help identify the differences between a cat and a dog. A *one-shot* model is a model that requires only a single image to train it. For example, a picture of a cat can be shown, and then the model can identify any cat image. A *few-shot* model requires only a few things to train the model. And, of course, *zero-shot* indicates the ability to identify something given no previous examples. LLMs are effi- cient learners and can do all three types of learning.

Open prompt_flow/few-shot-prompting/flow.dag.yaml in VS Code and the visual editor. Most of the flow looks like the one pictured earlier in figure 10.2, and the dif- ferences are highlighted in listing 10.3, which shows a YAML pseudocode represen- tation. The main differences between this and the previous flow are the inputs and LLM prompt.

<!-- Page 273 -->

***10.1 Understanding direct solution prompting* 249**
Listing 10.3 **few-shot-prompting** flow

Inputs: statement  : introduces the context and then asks for output expected : the expected answer to the statement

LLM: few_shot (the prompt used to ask the question) inputs:statement outputs: the prediction/answer to the statement

Embeddings: uses an LLM embedding model to create the embedding representation of the text

Embedding_predicted: embeds the output of the few_shot LLM Embedding_expected: embeds the output of the expected answer

Python: Evaluation (Python code to measure embedding similarity) Inputs: Embedding_predicted output Embedding_expected output Outputs: the similarity score between predicted and expected

Outputs: statement: -> input.statement expected: -> input.expected predicted: -> output.few_shot evaluation_score: output.evaluation **Evaluation score** **represents the similarity between** ### Example Output **expected and** { **predicted.** "evaluation_score": 0.906647282920417, "expected": "We ate sunner and watched the setting sun.", "predicted": "After a long hike, we sat by the lake and enjoyed a peaceful sunner as the sky turned **Uses sunner in** brilliant shades of orange and pink.", **a sentence** "statement": "A sunner is a meal we eat in Cananda at sunset, please use the word in a sentence" **This is a false statement but the** } **intent is to get the LLM to use the word as if it was real.**

Run the flow by pressing Shift-F5 or clicking the Play/Test button from the visual edi- tor. You should see output like listing 10.3 where the LLM has used the word *sunner* (a made-up term) correctly in a sentence given the initial statement. This exercise demonstrates the ability to use a prompt to alter the behavior of the LLM to be contrary to what it has learned. We’re changing what the LLM understands to be accurate. Furthermore, we then use that modified perspective to elicit the use of a made-up word. Open the few_shot.jinja2 prompt in VS Code, shown in listing 10.4. This listing demonstrates setting up a simple persona, that of an eccentric dictionary maker, and then providing examples of words it has defined and used before. The base of the

<!-- Page 274 -->

**250** CHAPTER 10 ***Agent reasoning and evaluation***

prompt allows for the LLM to extend the examples and produce similar results using other words.

Listing 10.4 **few_shot.jinja2**

system: You are an eccentric word dictionary maker. You will be asked to **Demonstrates an example defining a made- up word and using it in a sentence** construct a sentence using the word. The following are examples that demonstrate how to craft a sentence using the word. A "whatpu" is a small, furry animal native to Tanzania. An example of a sentence that uses the word whatpu is: We were traveling in Africa and we saw these very cute whatpus. To do a "farduddle" means to jump up and down really fast. An example of a sentence that uses the word farduddle is: I was so excited that I started to farduddle. **Demonstrates another example**

Please only return the sentence requested by the user. **A rule to prevent the** user: **LLM from outputting** {{statement}} **The input statement defines a extra information new word and asks for the use.**

You may say we’re forcing the LLM to hallucinate here, but this technique is the basis for modifying behavior. It allows prompts to be constructed to guide an LLM to do everything contrary to what it learned. This foundation of prompting also establishes techniques for other forms of altered behavior. From the ability to alter the percep- tion and background of an LLM, we’ll move on to demonstrate a final example of a direct solution in the next section.

# 10.1.3 Extracting generalities with zero-shot prompting

*Zero-shot prompting or learning* is the ability to generate a prompt in such a manner that allows the LLM to generalize. This generalization is embedded within the LLM and demonstrated through zero-shot prompting, where no examples are given, but instead a set of guidelines or rules are given to guide the LLM. Employing this technique is simple and works well to guide the LLM to generate replies given its internal knowledge and no other contexts. It’s a subtle yet powerful technique that applies the knowledge of the LLM to other applications. This tech- nique, combined with other prompting strategies, is proving effective at replacing other language classification models—models that identify the emotion or sentiment in text, for example. Open prompt_flow/zero-shot-prompting/flow.dag.yaml in the VS Code prompt flow visual editor. This flow is again almost identical to that shown earlier in figure 10.1 but differs slightly in implementation, as shown in listing 10.5.

<!-- Page 275 -->

***10.1 Understanding direct solution prompting* 251**
Listing 10.5 **zero-shot-prompting** flow

Inputs: statement  : the statement to be classified expected : the expected classification of the statement

LLM: zero_shot (the prompt used to classify) inputs: statement outputs: the predicted class given the statement

Embeddings: uses an LLM embedding model to create the embedding representation of the text

Embedding_predicted: embeds the output of the zero_shot LLM Embedding_expected: embeds the output of the expected answer

Python: Evaluation (Python code to measure embedding similarity) Inputs: Embedding_predicted output Embedding_expected output Outputs: the similarity score between predicted and expected

Outputs: statement: -> input.statement expected: -> input.expected predicted: -> output.few_shot evaluation_score: output.evaluation

### Example Output **Shows a perfect** **evaluation score** { **of 1.0** "evaluation_score": 1, "expected": "neutral", "predicted": "neutral", **The statement** "statement": "I think the vacation is okay. " **we’re asking the** } **LLM to classify**

Run the flow by pressing Shift-F5 within the VS Code prompt flow visual editor. You should see output similar to that shown in listing 10.5. Now open the zero_shot.jinja2 prompt as shown in listing 10.6. The prompt is simple and uses no examples to extract the sentiment from the text. What is especially interesting to note is that the prompt doesn’t even mention the phrase sentiment, and the LLM seems to understand the intent.

Listing 10.6 **zero_shot.jinja2**

system: Classify the text into neutral, negative or positive. Return on the result and nothing else. **Provides essential guidance on** user: **performing the** {{statement}} **The statement of classification text to classify**

<!-- Page 276 -->

**252** CHAPTER 10 ***Agent reasoning and evaluation***

Zero-shot prompt engineering is about using the ability of the LLM to generalize broadly based on its training material. This exercise demonstrates how knowledge within the LLM can be put to work for other tasks. The LLM’s ability to self-contextu- alize and apply knowledge can extend beyond its training. In the next section, we extend this concept further by looking at how LLMs can reason.

# 10.2 Reasoning in prompt engineering

LLMs like ChatGPT were developed to function as chat completion models, where text content is fed into the model, whose responses align with completing that request. LLMs were never trained to reason, plan, think, or have thoughts. However, much like we demonstrated with the examples in the previous section, LLMs can be prompted to extract their generalities and be extended beyond their initial design. While an LLM isn’t designed to reason, the training material fed into the model provides an understanding of reasoning, planning, and thought. There- fore, by extension, an LLM understands what reasoning is and can employ the con- cept of reasoning.

## Reasoning and planning

*Reasoning* is the ability of an intellect, artificial or not, to understand the process of thought or thinking through a problem. An intellect can understand that actions have outcomes, and it can use this ability to reason through which action from a set of actions can be applied to solve a given task.

*Planning* is the ability of the intellect to reason out the order of actions or tasks and apply the correct parameters to achieve a goal or outcome—the extent to which an intellectual plan depends on the scope of the problem. An intellect may combine mul- tiple levels of planning, from strategic and tactical to operational and contingent.

We’ll look at another set of prompt engineering techniques that allow or mimic rea- soning behavior to demonstrate this reasoning ability. Typically, when evaluating the application of reasoning, we look to having the LLM solve challenging problems it wasn’t designed to solve. A good source of such is based on logic, math, and word problems. Using the time travel theme, what class of unique problems could be better to solve than understanding time travel? Figure 10.3 depicts one example of a uniquely challenging time travel problem. Our goal is to acquire the ability to prompt the LLM in a manner that allows it to solve the problem correctly. Time travel problems are thought exercises that can be deceptively difficult to solve. The example in figure 10.3 is complicated to solve for an LLM, but the part it

planning

gets wrong may surprise you. The next section will use reasoning in prompts to solve these unique problems.

# 10.2.1 Chain of thought prompting

*Chain of thought* (CoT)prompting is a prompt engineering technique that employs the one-shot or few-shot examples that describe the reasoning and the steps to accomplish a desired goal. Through the demonstration of reasoning, the LLM can generalize this principle and reason through similar problems and goals. While the LLM isn’t trained with the goal of reasoning, we can elicit the model to reason, using prompt engineering. Open prompt_flow/chain-of-thought-prompting/flow.dag.yaml in the VS Code prompt flow visual editor. The elements of this flow are simple, as shown in figure 10.4. With only two LLM blocks, the flow first uses a CoT prompt to solve a complex ques- tion; then, the second LLM prompt evaluates the answer. Listing 10.7 shows the YAML pseudocode that describes the blocks and the inputs/outputs of the flow in more detail. The default problem statement in this example isn’t the same as in figure 10.3.

<!-- Page 278 -->

Dig into the inputs and check the problem statement; try to evaluate the problem yourself. Then, run the flow by pressing Shift-F5. You should see output similar to that shown in listing 10.7. Open the cot.jinja2 prompt file as shown in listing 10.8. This prompt gives a few examples of time travel problems and then the thought-out and reasoned solution. The process of showing the LLM the steps to complete the problem provides the rea- soning mechanism.

Listing 10.8 **cot.jinja2**

system: "In a time travel movie, Sarah travels back in time to **A few example** prevent a historic event from happening. She arrives **problem** 2 days before the event. After spending a day preparing, **statements** she attempts to change the event but realizes she has actually arrived 2 years early, not 2 days. She then decides to wait and live in the past until the event's **The solution** original date. How many days does Sarah spend in the past **to the problem** before the day of the event?" **statement, output** **as a sequence of reasoning steps** Chain of Thought:

Initial Assumption: Sarah thinks she has arrived 2 days before the event. Time Spent on Preparation: 1 day spent preparing. Realization of Error: Sarah realizes she's actually 2 years early. Conversion of Years to Days:

<!-- Page 280 -->

**256** CHAPTER 10 ***Agent reasoning and evaluation***

2 years = 2 × 365 = 730 days (assuming non-leap years). Adjust for the Day Spent Preparing: 730 - 1 = 729 days. Conclusion: Sarah spends 729 days in the past before the day of the event.

"In a sci-fi film, Alex is a time traveler who decides to go back in time to witness a famous historical battle **A few example** that took place 100 years ago, which lasted for 10 days. **problem** He arrives three days before the battle starts. However, **statements** after spending six days in the past, he jumps forward in time by 50 years and stays there for 20 days. Then, he travels back to witness the end of the battle. How many **The solution** days does Alex spend in the past before he sees the end of **to the problem** the battle?" **statement, output** **as a sequence of reasoning steps** Chain of Thought:

Initial Travel: Alex arrives three days before the battle starts. Time Spent Before Time Jump: Alex spends six days in the past. The battle has started and has been going on for 3 days (since he arrived 3 days early and has now spent 6 days, 3 + 3 = 6). First Time Jump: Alex jumps 50 years forward and stays for 20 days. This adds 20 days to the 6 days he's already spent in the past (6 + 20 = 26). Return to the Battle: When Alex returns, he arrives back on the same day he left (as per time travel logic). The battle has been going on for 3 days now. Waiting for the Battle to End: The battle lasts 10 days. Since he's already witnessed 3 days of it, he needs to wait for 7 more days. Conclusion: Alex spends a total of 3 (initial wait) + 3 (before the first jump) + 20 (50 years ago) + 7 (after returning) = 33 days in the past before he sees the end of the battle. Think step by step but only show the final answer to the statement.

You may note that the solution to figure 10.3 is also provided as an example in listing

10.8. It’s also helpful to go back and review listing 10.7 for the reply from the LLM about the problem. From this, you can see the reasoning steps the LLM applied to get its final answer. Now, we can look at the prompt that evaluates how well the solution solved the problem. Open evaluate_answer.jinja2, shown in listing 10.9, to review the prompt used. The prompt is simple, uses zero-shot prompting, and allows the LLM to general- ize how it should score the expected and predicted. We could provide examples and scores, thus changing this to an example of a few-shot classification. Listing 10.9 **evaluate_answer.jinja2** system:
**The rules for evaluating the** Please confirm that expected and predicted results are **solution** the same for the given problem.

<!-- Page 281 -->

***10.2 Reasoning in prompt engineering* 257**
Return a score from 0 to 1 where 1 is a perfect match and 0 is no match. Please just return the score and not the explanation. **Direction to only return the score** user: **and nothing else** Problem: {{problem}} **The initial problem** Expected result: {{expected}} **statement**

Predicted result: {{predicted}} **The expected or** **The output from the grounded answer** **CoT prompt earlier**

Looking at the LLM output shown earlier in listing 10.7, you can see why the evalua- tion step may get confusing. Perhaps a fix to this could be suggesting to the LLM to provide the final answer in a single statement. In the next section, we move on to another example of prompt reasoning.

# 10.2.2 Zero-shot CoT prompting

As our time travel demonstrates, CoT prompting can be expensive in terms of prompt generation for a specific class of problem. While not as effective, there are techniques similar to CoT that don’t use examples and can be more generalized. This section will examine a straightforward phrase employed to elicit reasoning in LLMs. Open prompt_flow/zero-shot-cot-prompting/flow.dag.yaml in the VS Code prompt flow visual editor. This flow is very similar to the previous CoT, as shown in fig- ure 10.4. The next lsting shows the YAML pseudocode that describes the flow.

Listing 10.10 **zero-shot-CoT-prompting** flow

Inputs: statement  : the statement problem to be solved expected : the expected solution to the problem

LLM: cot (the prompt used to solve the problem) inputs: statement outputs: the predicted answer given the problem statement

LLM: evaluate_answer (the prompt used to evaluate the solution) inputs: statement: -> input.statement expected: -> input.expected predicted: -> output.cot

outputs: a score of how well the problem was answered

Outputs: statement: -> input.statement expected: -> input.expected predicted: -> output.cot

<!-- Page 282 -->

**258** CHAPTER 10 ***Agent reasoning and evaluation***

evaluation_score: output.evaluate_answer

### Example Output { **The final evaluation score** "evaluation_score": "1", "expected": "After the final jump, ➥ Max finds himself in the year 1980 and **The expected** he is 75 years old.", **answer** "predicted": "Max starts in… ➥ Therefore, after the final jump, ➥ Max is 75 years old and in the year 1980.", **The predicted** "statement": "In a complex time travel …" **answer (the** } **steps have been** **The initial problem omitted showing statement the final answer)**

Run/test the flow in VS Code by pressing Shift-F5 while in the visual editor. The flow will run, and you should see output similar to that shown in listing 10.10. This exercise example performs better than the previous example on the same problem. Open the cot.jinja2 prompt in VS Code, as shown in listing 10.11. This is a much simpler prompt than the previous example because it only uses zero-shot. However, one key phrase turns this simple prompt into a powerful reasoning engine. The line in the prompt Let’s think step by step triggers the LLM to consider internal context show- ing reasoning. This, in turn, directs the LLM to reason out the problem in steps.

Listing 10.11 **cot.jinja2**

system: **A magic line** You are an expert in solving time travel problems. **that formulates** You are given a time travel problem and you have to solve it. **reasoning from** Let's think step by step. **the LLM** Please finalize your answer in a single statement. **Asks the LLM to provide a final** user: **The problem** **statement of the** {{statement}} **statement the LLM answer** **is asked to solve**

Similar phrases asking the LLM to think about the steps or asking it to respond in steps also extract reasoning. We’ll demonstrate a similar but more elaborate tech- nique in the next section.

# 10.2.3 Step by step with prompt chaining

We can extend the behavior of asking an LLM to think step by step into a chain of prompts that force the LLM to solve the problem in steps. In this section, we look at a technique called *prompt chaining* that forces an LLM to process problems in steps. Open the prompt_flow/prompt-chaining/flow.dag.yaml file in the visual editor, as shown in figure 10.5. Prompt chaining breaks up the reasoning method used to solve a problem into chains of prompts. This technique forces the LLM to answer the problem in terms of steps.

<!-- Page 283 -->

***10.2 Reasoning in prompt engineering* 259**
**LLM prompt first decomposes the problem into steps.**

**LLM then calculates the output for each step.**

**LLM calculates the solution using the steps.**

Figure 10.5 The prompt chaining flow

Listing 10.12 shows the YAML pseudocode that describes the flow in a few more details. This flow chains the output of the first LLM block into the second and then from the second into the third. Forcing the LLM to process the problem this way uncovers the reasoning pattern, but it can also be overly verbose.

Listing 10.12 **prompt-chaining** flow

Inputs: statement : the statement problem to be solved

LLM: decompose_steps (the prompt used to decompose the problem) inputs: **Start of the chain** statement: -> input.statement **of prompts** outputs: the breakdown of steps to solve the problem

LLM: calculate_steps (the prompt used to calculate the steps) inputs: statement: -> input.statement **Output from** decompose_steps: -> output.decompose_steps **the previous step injected**

outputs: the calculation for each step **into this step**

<!-- Page 284 -->

**260** CHAPTER 10 ***Agent reasoning and evaluation***

LLM: calculate_solution (attempts to solve the problem) inputs: statement: -> input.statement **Output from** decompose_steps: -> output.decompose_steps **two previous** calculate_steps: -> output.calculate_steps **steps injected into this step** outputs: the final solution statement

Outputs: statement: -> input.statement decompose_steps: -> output.decompose_steps calculate_steps: -> output.calculate_steps calculate_solution: -> output.calculate_solution

### Example Output { "calculate_steps": "1. The days spent by Alex", "decompose_steps": "To figure out the …", **The final solution** "solution": "Alex spends 13 days in the **statement,** ➥ past before the end of the battle.", **although wrong,** "statement": "In a sci-fi film, Alex …" **is closer.** }

Run the flow by pressing Shift-F5 from the visual editor, and you’ll see the output as shown in listing 10.12. The answer is still not correct for the Alex problem, but we can see all the work the LLM is doing to reason out the problem. Open up all three prompts: decompose_steps.jinja2, calculate_steps.jinja2, and calculate_solution.jinja2 (see listings 10.13, 10.14, and 10.15, respectively). All three prompts shown in the listings can be compared to show how outputs chain together.

# 10.3.1 Evaluating self-consistency prompting

Consistency in prompting is more than just lowering the temperature parameter we send to an LLM. Often, we want to generate a consistent plan or solution and still use a high temperature to better evaluate all the variations to a plan. By evaluating multi- ple different plans, we can get a better sense of the overall value of a solution. *Self-consistent prompting* is the technique of generating multiple plans/solutions for a given problem. Then, those plans are evaluated, and the more frequent or consis- tent plan is accepted. Imagine three plans generated, where two are similar, but the third is different. Using self-consistency, we evaluate the first two plans as the more consistent answer. Open prompt_flow/self-consistency-prompting/flow.dag.yaml in the VS Code prompt flow visual editor. The flow diagram shows the simplicity of the prompt genera- tion flow in figure 10.7. Next to it in the diagram is the self-consistency evaluation flow. Prompt flow uses a direct acyclic graph (DAG) format to execute the flow logic. DAGs are an excellent way of demonstrating and executing flow logic, but because they are *acyclic,* meaning they can’t repeat, they can’t execute loops. However, because prompt flow provides a batch processing mechanism, we can use that to simulate loops or repetition in a flow. Referring to figure 10.6, we can see that self-consistency processes the input three times before collecting the results and determining the best plan/reply. We can apply this same pattern but use batch processing to generate the outputs. Then, the evalua- tion flow will aggregate the results and determine the best answer. Open the self-consistency-prompting/cot.jinja2 prompt template in VS Code (see listing 10.16). The listing was shortened, as we’ve seen parts before. This

***10.3 Employing evaluation for consistent solutions* 265**
Listing 10.17 shows the JSON output from executing the flow in batch mode. The statements.jsonl file has five identical Alex time travel problem entries. Using identical entries allows us to simulate the prompt executing five times on the dupli- cate entry.

You can view the flow produced by pressing the Ctrl key and clicking the output link, highlighted in listing 10.17. This will open another instance of VS Code, showing a folder with all the output from the run. We now want to check the most consistent answer. Fortunately, the evaluation feature in prompt flow can help us identify consis- tent answers using similarity matching. Open self-consistency-evaluation/flow.dag.yaml in VS Code (see figure

10.7). This flow embeds the predicted answer and then uses an aggregation to deter- mine the most consistent answer. From the flow, open consistency.py in VS Code, as shown in listing 10.18. The code for this tool function calculates the cosine similarity for all pairs of answers. Then, it finds the most similar answer, logs it, and outputs that as the answer. Listing 10.18 **consistency.py** from promptflow import tool from typing import List import numpy as np from scipy.spatial.distance import cosine

<!-- Page 290 -->

**266** CHAPTER 10 ***Agent reasoning and evaluation***

@tool def consistency(texts: List[str], embeddings: List[List[float]]) -> str: if len(embeddings) != len(texts): **Calculates the mean of all the embeddings** raise ValueError("The number of embeddings ➥ must match the number of texts.") **Calculates cosine similarity for each** mean_embedding = np.mean(embeddings, axis=0) **pair of embeddings** similarities = [1 - cosine(embedding, mean_embedding) ➥ for embedding in embeddings] **Finds the index** most_similar_index = np.argmax(similarities) **of the most** **similar answer** from promptflow import log_metric log_metric(key="highest_ranked_output", value=texts[most_similar_index])

return texts[most_similar_index] **Returns the text** **Logs the output as a metric**

**for the most similar answer**

We need to run the evaluation flow in batch mode as well. Open self-consistency- evaluation/flow.dag.yaml in VS Code and run the flow in batch mode (beaker icon). Then, select Existing Run as the flow input, and when prompted, choose the top or the last run you just executed as input. Again, after the flow completes processing, you’ll see an output like that shown in listing 10.17. Ctrl-click on the output folder link to open a new instance of VS Code showing the results. Locate and open the metric.json file in VS Code, as shown in

figure 10.9.

The answer shown in figure 10.9 is still incorrect for this run. You can continue a few more batch runs of the prompt and/or increase the number of runs in a batch and then evaluate flows to see if you get better answers. This technique is generally more helpful for more straightforward problems but still demonstrates an inability to reason out complex problems. Self-consistency uses a reflective approach to evaluate the most likely thought. However, the most likely thing is certainly not always the best. Therefore, we must con- sider a more comprehensive approach in the next section.

# 10.3.2 Evaluating tree of thought prompting

As mentioned earlier, ToT prompting, as shown in figure 10.6, combines self-evalua- tion and prompt chaining techniques. As such, it breaks down the sequence of plan- ning into a chain of prompts, but at each step in the chain, it provides for multiple evaluations. This creates a tree that can be executed and evaluated at each level, breadth-first, or from top to bottom, depth-first.

Figure 10.10 shows the difference between executing a tree using breadth-first or

depth-first. Unfortunately, due to the DAG execution pattern of prompt flow, we can’t quickly implement the depth-first method, but breadth-first works just fine.

**268** CHAPTER 10 ***Agent reasoning and evaluation***

Open tree-of-thought-evaluation/flow.dag.yaml in VS Code. The visual of the flow is shown in figure 10.11. This flow functions like a breadth-first ToT pattern—the flow chains together a series of prompts asking the LLM to return multiple plans at each step.

**First asks LLM to create 3 plans, but not solutions as an expert**

**Output from an LLM block is a single string, so this block splits**

**Each LLM node calculates 3 versions the text into nodes.** **of the output for each step in the plan.**

**Splits the output text into 3 nodes again**

**Each answer node calculates the output of the answer.**

Figure 10.11 ToT pattern expressed and prompt flow

Because the flow executes in a breadth-first style, each level output of the nodes is also evaluated. Each node in the flow uses a pair of semantic functions—one to generate the answer and the other to evaluate the answer. The semantic function is a custom Python flow block that processes multiple inputs and generates multiple outputs. Listing 10.19 shows the semantic_function.py tool. This general tool is reused for multiple blocks in this flow. It also demonstrates the embedding functionality from the SK for direct use within prompt flow.

Listing 10.19 **semantic_function.py**

@tool def my_python_tool( input: str, input_node: int, history: str,

The semantic function tool is used in the tree’s experts, nodes, and answer blocks. At each step, the function determines if any text is being input. If there is no text, the block returns with no execution. Passing no text to a block means that the previous block failed evaluation. By evaluating before each step, ToT short-circuits the execu-

<!-- Page 294 -->

**270** CHAPTER 10 ***Agent reasoning and evaluation***

This may be a complex pattern to grasp at first, so go ahead and run the flow in VS Code. Listing 10.20 shows just the answer node output of a run; these results may vary from what you see but should be similar. Nodes that return no text either failed evalu- ation or their parents did.

Listing 10.20 Output from **tree-of-thought-evaluation** flow

{ **Represents that the first The plan for node 2 and** "answer_1_1": "", **node plans weren’t valid** **answer 2 failed evaluation** "answer_1_2": "", **and not executed** **and wasn’t run.** "answer_1_3": "", "answer_2_1": "Alex spends a total of 29 days in the past before he sees the end of the battle.", "answer_2_2": "", "answer_2_3": "Alex spends a total of 29 days in the past before he sees the end of the battle.", "answer_3_1": "", "answer_3_2": "Alex spends a total of 29 days in the past before he sees the end of the battle.", "answer_3_3": "Alex spends a total of 9 days in the past before he sees the end of the battle.", **The plan for this node failed to evaluate and wasn’t run.**

The output in listing 10.20 shows how only a select set of nodes was evaluated. In most cases, the evaluated nodes returned an answer that could be valid. Where no output was produced, it means that the node itself or its parent wasn’t valid. When sibling nodes all return empty, the parent node fails to evaluate. As we can see, ToT is valid for complex problems but perhaps not very practical. The execution of this flow can take up to 27 calls to an LLM to generate an output. In practice, it may only do half that many calls, but that’s still a dozen or more calls to answer a single problem.

# Agent planning and feedback

## This chapter covers

- Planning for an LLM and implementing it in agents and assistants
- Using the OpenAI Assistants platform via custom actions
- Implementing/testing a generic planner on LLMs
- Using the feedback mechanism in advanced models
- Planning, reasoning, evaluation, and feedback in building agentic systems Now that we’ve examined how large language models (LLMs) can reason and plan, this chapter takes this concept a step further by employing planning within an agent framework. Planning should be at the core of any agent/assistant platform or toolkit. We’ll start by looking at the basics of planning and how to implement a planner through prompting. Then, we’ll see how planning operates using the OpenAI Assistants platform, which automatically incorporates planning. From there, we’ll build and implement a general planner for LLMs. Planning can only go so far, and an often-unrecognized element is feedback. Therefore, in the last sections of the chapter, we explore feedback and implement

it within a planner. You must be familiar with the content of chapter 10, so please review it if you need to, and when you’re ready, let’s begin planning.

# 11.1 Planning: The essential tool for all agents/assistants

Agents and assistants who can’t plan and only follow simple interactions are nothing more than chatbots. As we’ve seen throughout this book, our goal isn’t to build bots but rather to build autonomous thinking agents—agents that can take a goal, work out how to solve it, and then return with the results.

Figure 11.1 explains the overall planning process that the agent/assistant will

undertake. This figure was also presented in chapter 1, but let’s review it now in more detail. At the top of the figure, a user submits a goal. In an agentic system, the agent takes the goal, constructs the plan, executes it, and then returns the results.

make the model appear more intelligent and capable. Therefore, in the next exercise, we’ll look at an example to set a baseline and differentiate between an LLM that can’t plan and an agent that can. For the next exercise, we’ll use Nexus to demonstrate how raw LLMs can’t plan independently. If you need assistance installing, setting up, and running Nexus, refer to chapter 7. After you have Nexus installed and ready, we can begin running it with the Gradio interface, using the commands shown next.

Gradio is an excellent web interface tool built to demonstrate Python machine learn- ing projects. Figure 11.2 shows the Gradio Nexus interface and the process for creat- ing an agent and using an agent engine (OpenAI, Azure, and Groq) of your choice. You can’t use LM Studio unless the model/server supports tool/action use. Anthropic’s Claude supports internal planning, so for the purposes of this exercise, avoid using this model.

***11.1 Planning: The essential tool for all agents/assistants* 275**
After creating the agent, we want to give it specific actions (tools) to undertake or complete a goal. Generally, providing only the actions an agent needs to complete its goal is best for a few reasons:

- More actions can confuse an agent into deciding which to use or even how to solve a goal.
- APIs have limits on the number of tools that can be submitted; at the time of writing, hitting this limit is relatively easy.
- Agents may use your actions in ways you didn’t intend unless that’s your goal. Be warned, however, that actions can have consequences.
- Safety and security need to be considered. LLMs aren’t going to take over the world, but they make mistakes and quickly get off track. Remember, these agents will operate independently and may perform any action. WARNING While writing this book and working with and building agents over many hours, I have encountered several instances of agents going rogue with actions, from downloading files to writing and executing code when not intended, continually iterating from tool to tool, and even deleting files they shouldn’t have. Watching an agent emerge new behaviors using actions can be fun, but things can quickly go astray.
For this exercise, we’ll define the goal described in the following listing.

Listing 11.2 Demonstrating planning: The goal

Search Wikipedia for pages on {topic} and download each page and save it to a file called Wikipedia_{topic}.txt

This goal will demonstrate the following actions:

- search_wikipedia(topic)—Searches Wikipedia and returns page IDs for the given search term.
- get_wikipedia_page(page_id)—Downloads the page content given the page ID.
- save_file—Saves the content to a file.
Set the actions on the agent, as shown in figure 11.3. You’ll also want to make sure the Planner is set to None. We’ll look at setting up and using planners soon. You don’t have to click Save; the interface automatically saves an agent’s changes. After you choose the actions and planner, enter the goal in listing 11.2. Then click Create New Thread to instantiate a new conversation. Substitute the topic you want to search for in the chat input, and wait for the agent to respond. Here’s an example of the goal filled with the topic, but again, use any topic you like:

Search Wikipedia for pages on Calgary and download each page and save it to a file called Wikipedia_Calgary.txt.

**Select only the three actions: Make sure to select search_wikipedia, None for the Planner.**

**get_wikipedia_page, and save_file**

Figure 11.3 Selecting the actions for the agent and disabling the planner

Figure 11.4 shows the results of submitting the goal to the plain agent. We see the

agent executed the tool/action to search for the topic but couldn’t execute any steps beyond that. If you recall from our discussion and code example of actions in chapter 5, OpenAI, Groq, and Azure OpenAI all support parallel actions but not sequential or planned actions. The LLM can answer reasonably well if you submit a goal with several parallel tasks/actions. However, if the actions are sequential, requiring one step to be depen- dent on another, it will fail. Remember, parallel actions are standalone actions that can be run alongside others.

<!-- Page 301 -->

***11.2 Understanding the sequential planning process* 277**
Figure 11.4 The results from trying to get the agent/LLM to complete the goal

Anthropic’s Claude and OpenAI Assistants support sequential action planning. This means both models can be called with sequential plans, and the model will execute them and return the results. In the next section, we’ll explore sequential planning and then demonstrate it in action.

# 11.2 Understanding the sequential planning process

In the next exercise, we’ll ask an OpenAI assistant to solve the same goal. If you have Anthropic/Claude credentials and have the engine configured, you can also try this exercise with that model.

Figure 11.5 shows the difference between executing tasks sequentially (planning)

and using iteration. If you’ve used GPTs, assistants, or Claude Sonnet 3.5, you’ve likely already experienced this difference. These advanced tools already incorporate plan- ning by prompt annotations, advanced training, or combining both. As LLM and chat services evolve, most models will likely natively support some form of planning and tool use. However, most models, including GPT-4o, only sup- port action/tool use today. Let’s open the GPT Assistants Playground to demonstrate sequential planning in action. If you need help, refer to the setup guide in chapter 6. We’ll use the same goal but, this time, run it against an assistant (which has built-in planning).

Goal is complete, and user has the output.

After you launch the Playground, create a new assistant, and assign it the search_ wikipedia, get_wikipedia_page, and save_file actions. Figure 11.6 shows the results of entering the goal to the assistant. As you can see, the assistant completed all the tasks behind the scenes and responded with the user’s final requested output, achiev-

To demonstrate the effectiveness of the OpenAI Assistant’s planner, we added another task, summarizing each page, to the goal. The inserted task didn’t have a function/tool, but the assistant was savvy enough to use its ability to summarize the content. You can see the output of what the assistant produced by opening the [root folder]assistants_working_folder/Wikipedia_{topic}.txt file and reviewing the contents. Now that we understand how LLMs function without planners and plan- ning, we can move on to creating our planners in the next section.

LLM tools such as LangChain and Semantic Kernel (SK) have many planners using various strategies. However, writing our planner is relatively easy, and Nexus also sup- ports a plugin-style interface allowing you to add other planners from tools such as

Planners may sound complicated, but they are easily implemented through prompt engineering strategies that incorporate planning and reasoning. In chapter 10, we covered the basics of reasoning and deriving plans, and now we can put those skills to good use. Listing 11.3 shows a sequential planner derived from the SK, which is extended to incorporate iteration. Prompt annotation planners like those shown in the listing can be adapted to fit specific needs or be more general like those shown. This planner uses JSON, but planners could use any format an LLM understands, including code.

Listing 11.3 **basic_nexus_planner.py**

**The preamble instructions telling the agent how to process the examples** You are a planner for Nexus. Your job is to create a properly formatted JSON plan step by step, to satisfy the goal given. Create a list of subtasks based off the [GOAL] provided. Each subtask must be from within the [AVAILABLE FUNCTIONS] list. Do not use any functions that are not in the list. Base your decisions on which functions to use from the description and the name of the function. Sometimes, a function may take arguments. Provide them if necessary. The plan should be as short as possible. You will also be given a list of corrective, suggestive and epistemic feedback from previous plans to help you make your decision. For example:

Figure 11.7 shows the process of building and running a planning prompt, from

building to execution to finally returning the results to the user. Planners work by building a planning prompt, submitting it to an LLM to construct the plan, parsing and executing the plan locally, returning the results to an LLM to evaluate and sum- marize, and finally returning the final output back to the user. It’s essential to notice a few subtle details about the planning process. Typically, the plan is built in isolation by not adding context history. This is done to focus on the goal because most planning prompts consume many tokens. Executing the functions within the executor is usually done in a local environment and may include calling APIs, executing code, or even running machine learning models. Listing 11.4 shows the code for the create_plan function from the BasicNexus- Planner class; tools such as LangChain and SK use similar patterns. The process loads the agent’s actions as a string. The goal and available functions list are then inserted into the planner prompt template using the PromptTemplateManager, which is just a wrapper

**284** CHAPTER 11 ***Agent planning and feedback***

The returned context from the entire execution is sent in a final call to the LLM, which summarizes the results and returns a response. If everything goes as planned, the LLM will respond with a summary of the results. If there is an error or something is missing, the LLM may try to fix the problem or inform the user of the error. Let’s now open Nexus again and test a planner in operation. Load up the same agent you used last time, but select the planner under the Advanced options this time, as shown in figure 11.8. Then, enter the goal prompt as you did before, and let the agent take it away.

Figure 11.8 The results from requesting to complete the goal in Nexus using the basic planner

After a few minutes, the agent returns with the saved file, and in some cases, it may provide extra information, such as the next steps and what to do with the output. This is because the agent was given a high-level overview of what it accomplished. Remem- ber, though, that plan execution is done at the local level, and only context, plan, and goal were sent to the LLM.

<!-- Page 309 -->

***11.4 Reviewing a stepwise planner: OpenAI Strawberry* 285**
This means that plan execution can be completed by any process, not necessarily by the agent. Executing a plan outside the LLM reduces the tokens and tool use the agent needs to perform. This also means that an LLM doesn’t need to support tools usage to use a planner. Internally, when a planner is enabled within Nexus, the agent engine tool is bypassed. Instead, the planner completes the action execution, and the agent is only aware of the actions through the passing of the output context. This can be good for models that support tool use but can’t plan. However, a planner may limit functional- ity for models that support both tool use and planning, such as Claude. In general, you’ll want to understand the capabilities of the LLM you’re using. If you’re unsure of those details, then a little trial and error can also work. Ask the agent to complete a multistep goal with and without planning enabled, and then see the results. Planning allows agents to complete multiple sequential tasks to achieve more com- plex goals. The problem with external or prompt planning is that it bypasses the feed- back iteration loop, which can help correct problems quickly. Because of this, OpenAI and others are now directly integrating reasoning and planning at the LLM level, as we’ll see in the next section.

# 11.4 Reviewing a stepwise planner: OpenAI Strawberry

The release of the o1-preview model, code named Strawberry, introduced a dra- matic shift in the type of LLMs becoming available for agentic systems. Strawberry was not only proclaimed to be more efficient at math, science, and general calcula- tion tasks but also able to engage in reasoning, planning, evaluation, and feedback directly in the LLM. Consider our time travel problem from chapter 10 and shown again in figure 11.9. If you recall, this problem was difficult to solve using GPT-4 and other similar LLMs. However, with the application of reasoning and feedback, we were able to produce output that was occasionally correct. As an experiment, enter this problem into ChatGPT using the o1-preview model, as shown in listing 11.6. Sit back for a few seconds and wait for the answer. Yep, the model still gets it wrong.

Listing 11.6 Time travel reasoning/planning problem

In a sci-fi film, Alex is a time traveler who decides to go back in time to witness a famous historical battle that took place 100 years ago, which lasted for 10 days. He arrives three days before the battle starts. However, after spending six days in the past, he jumps forward in time by 50 years and stays there for 20 days. Then, he travels back to witness the end of the battle. How many days does Alex spend in the past before he sees the end of the battle?

While it may be somewhat disappointing to see the model get the wrong answer, it does, however, do a far better job of breaking down the problem and demonstrating

its answer. Listing 11.7 shows the sample output from posing the problem in listing

11.6 to the Strawberry model. Note, you may get a different answer because of the sto- chastic nature of the LLM. Listing 11.7 o1-preview response to time travel problem To determine how many days Alex spends in the past before witnessing the end of the battle, let's reconstruct the timeline step by step: Arrival in the Past: Alex arrives 3 days before the battle begins. He spends these 3 days waiting for the battle to start. During the Battle: The battle starts, and Alex experiences the first 3 days of it. At this point, he has spent a total of 6 days in the past (3 days before the battle and 3 days during the battle). Time Jump Forward:
**It becomes obvious** After these 6 days, Alex jumps 50 years forward in time. **where the model is** He spends 20 days in this future time. **making the error.** Return to the Past: Alex then returns to the past to witness the end of the battle. Since the battle lasts 10 days and he left after day 3 of the battle, there are 7 days remaining in the battle. However, because he was away for 20 days, which is longer than the remaining 7 days of the battle, he must return to a point in time before the battle ends to witness its conclusion. To see the end of the battle, he returns to the past on the last day of

<!-- Page 311 -->

***11.4 Reviewing a stepwise planner: OpenAI Strawberry* 287**
the battle. Final Days Spent Before the Battle Ends: Upon returning, he spends 1 more day in the past to witness the battle's end. Total Days Spent in the Past Before Seeing the End: 6 days before jumping forward in time. 1 day after returning to the past. Total: 6 + 1 = 7 days. Answer: 7

Because we know the right answer is 27, we know the LLM is wrong, but if we didn’t, we could just as easily assume that the work and reasoning were all correct. Problems like this can happen when we remove feedback in LLM interactions and agentic sys- tems. Feedback can guide the model to correct itself. However, what if we didn’t know the correct answer was 27 (26, if you assume he doesn’t spend the day to witness the battle) and assumed the LLM or agent was cor- rect? Well, this is a problem we can rectify with a couple of simple prompts that can engage the LLM in reasoning and planning feedback. However, these techniques are more effective with LLMs or wrappers such as the OpenAI Assistants, which provide reasoning and planning within the model. What we want to do is provide feedback to the LLM, but understanding what that feedback is will likely be difficult for us. Fortunately, we can elicit feedback directly from the LLM, provided we give the correct answer. Listing 11.8 shows how to gener- ate constructive feedback from the LLM concerning our time travel problem.

Listing 11.8 Generating feedback

the correct answer is 27, please review what you did wrong and suggest feedback you could give yourself when trying to solve similar future problems

Entering this after the model answers the question wrong will generate feedback that you can use to guide the model through prompting or as part of system instructions. Listing 11.9 shows an example of the feedback provided by o1-preview. You can then extract this feedback and augment the instructions the next time you want to tackle complex time travel problems.

Listing 11.9 Generated feedback

Feedback for Future Problems Understanding Time Frames in Time Travel: Relative Time Frames: Always consider the time periods relative to the original point of reference. In this problem, even though Alex jumps forward 50 years, he is still in the past relative to his original present time. Including All Relevant Periods: Ensure that all time periods spent in the past (or future) are included in the total calculation, even if they involve moving to different points in time. Time Continuity:

<!-- Page 312 -->

**288** CHAPTER 11 ***Agent planning and feedback***

Remember that while the traveler moves through time, events in other time periods continue to progress unless specified otherwise. Application: Careful Reading: Pay close attention to the details provided, such as the durations and the sequences of time jumps. Visualization: It may help to draw a timeline to visualize the sequence of events and time periods involved. Double-Checking Calculations: After solving, revisit each step to ensure all time periods are accounted for correctly.

This feedback technique will consistently work on models such as o1-preview, but other models may still struggle to answer correctly, even given this feedback. Over time, as models become smarter, this technique will likely generally work on most models. However, this feedback mechanism will likely be essential even as models get progressively brighter. because language is nuanced, and not every problem we challenge LLMs with may have an obvious absolute answer. Take our example prob- lem, for instance. This problem is an excellent example of requiring the problem solver to make assumptions and draw correlations from the question. There are still plenty of areas in science, from geology to behavioral science, where answering the same problem may yield a range of answers. Let’s look next at a few techniques for how the application of reasoning, planning, evaluation, and feedback can be applied to agentic systems.

# 11.5 Applying planning, reasoning, evaluation, and feedback to assistant and agentic systems

In recent chapters, we’ve examined how the agentic components of planning, reason- ing, feedback, and evaluation can be implemented. Now we look at how, when, and where those components can be integrated into assistant and agentic systems for real- time production, research, or development. While not all of these components may fit the same into every application, it’s use- ful to understand where and when to apply which component. In the next section, we look at how planning can be integrated into assistant/agentic systems.

## 11.5.1 Application of assistant/agentic planning

Planning is the component where an assistant or agent can plan to undertake a set of tasks, whether they are in series, parallel, or some other combination. We typically associate planning with tool use, and, rightfully, any system using tools will likely want a capable planner. However, not all systems are created equally, so in table 11.1, we’ll review where, when, and how to implement planners.

<!-- Page 313 -->

Table 11.1 shows several varied application scenarios in which we may find an assis-

tant or agent deployed to assist in some capacity. To provide further information and guidance, this list provides more details about how planning may be employed in each application:

- *Personal assistant*—While this application has been slow to roll out, LLM per- sonal assistants promise to surpass Alexa and Siri in the future. Planning will be essential to these new assistants/agents to coordinate numerous complex tasks and execute tools (actions) in series or parallel.
- *Customer service bot*—Due to the controlled nature of this environment, it’s unlikely that assistants engaged directly with customers will have controlled and very specific tools use. This means that these types of assistants will likely not require extensive planning.
- *Autonomous agent*—As we’ve seen in previous chapters, agents with the ability to plan can complete a series of complex tasks for various goals. Planning will be an essential element of any autonomous agentic system.
- *Collaborative workflows*—Think of these as agents or assistants that sit alongside coders or writers. While these workflows are still in early development, think of a workflow where agents are automatically tasked with writing and executing test code alongside developers. Planning will be an essential part of executing these complex future workflows.

<!-- Page 314 -->

**290** CHAPTER 11 ***Agent planning and feedback***

- *Game AI*—While applying LLMs to games is still in early stages, it isn’t hard to imagine in-game agents or assistants that can assist or challenge the player. Giv- ing these agents the ability to plan and execute complex workflows could dis- rupt how and with whom we play games.
- *Research*—Similar to collaborative workflows, these agents will be responsible for deriving new ideas from existing sources of information. Finding that infor- mation will likely be facilitated through extensive tool use, which will benefit from coordination of planning.
As you can see, planning is an essential part of many LLM applications, whether through coordination of tool use or otherwise. In the next section, we look at the next component of reasoning and how it can be applied to the same application stack.

# 11.5.2 Application of assistant/agentic reasoning

Reasoning, while often strongly associated with planning and task completion, is a component that can also stand by itself. As LLMs mature and get smarter, reasoning is often included within the LLM itself. However, not all applications may benefit from extensive reasoning, as it often introduces a thinking cycle within the LLM response.

Table 11.2 describes at a high level how the reasoning component can be integrated

with various LLM application types.

***11.5 Applying planning, reasoning, evaluation, and feedback to assistant and agentic sys-*291**
Table 11.2 shows several varied application scenarios in which we may find an assis-
 tant or agent deployed to assist in some capacity. To provide further information and guidance, this list provides more details about how reasoning may be employed in each application:
- *Personal assistant*—Depending on the application, the amount of reasoning an agent employs may be limited. Reasoning is a process that requires the LLM to think through a problem, and this often requires longer response times depend- ing on the complexity of the problem and the extent of the prompt. In many situations, responses intended to be closer to real-time reasoning may be dis- abled or turned down. While this may limit the complexity at which an agent can interact, limited or no reasoning can improve response times and increase user enjoyment.
- *Customer service bot*—Again, because of the controlled nature of this environ- ment, it’s unlikely that assistants engaged directly with customers will need to perform complex or any form of reasoning.
- *Autonomous agent*—While reasoning is a strong component of autonomous agents, we still don’t know how much reasoning is too much. As models such as Strawberry become available for agentic workflows, we can gauge at what point extensive reasoning may not be needed. This will surely be the case for well-defined autonomous agent workflows.
- *Collaborative workflows*—Again, applying reasoning creates an overhead in the LLM interaction. Extensive reasoning may provide benefits for some workflows, while other well-defined workflows may suffer. This may mean that these types of work- flows will benefit from multiple agents—those with reasoning and those without.
- *Game AI*—Similar to other applications, heavy-reasoning applications may not be appropriate for most game AIs. Games will especially require LLM response times to be quick, and this will surely be the application of reasoning for gen- eral tactical agents. Of course, that doesn’t preclude the use of other reasoning agents that may provide more strategic control.
- *Research*—Reasoning will likely be essential to any complex research task for sev- eral reasons. A good example is the application of the Strawberry model, which we’ve already seen in research done in mathematics and the sciences.
While we often consider reasoning in tandem with planning, there may be conditions where the level at which each is implemented may differ. In the next section we con- sider the agent pillar of evaluation of various applications.

# 11.5.3 Application of evaluation to agentic systems

Evaluation is the component of agentic/assistant systems that can guide how well the system performs. While we demonstrated incorporating evaluation in some agentic workflows, evaluation is often an external component in agentic systems. However, it’s also a core component of most LLM applications and not something that should be

overlooked in most developments. Table 11.3 describes at a high level how the evalua- tion component can be integrated with various LLM application types.

Table 11.3 shows several varied application scenarios in which we may find an assis-

tant or agent deployed to assist in some capacity. To provide further information and guidance, this list provides more details about how evaluation may be employed in each application:

- *Personal assistant*—In most cases, an evaluation component will be used to process and guide the performance of agent responses. In systems primarily employing retrieval augmented generation (RAG) for document exploration, the evaluation indicates how well the assistant responds to information requests.
- *Customer service bot*—Evaluating service bots is critical to understanding how well the bot responds to customer requests. In many cases, a strong RAG knowledge element may be an element of the system that will require extensive and ongoing evaluation. Again, with most evaluation components, this element is external to

- *Autonomous agent*—In most cases, a manual review of agent output will be a pri- mary guide to the success of an autonomous agent. However, in some cases, internal evaluation can help guide the agent when it’s undertaking complex tasks or as a means of improving the final output. Multiple agent systems, such as CrewAI and AutoGen, are examples of autonomous agents that use internal feedback to improve the generated output.
- *Collaborative workflows*—In most direct cases, manual evaluation is ongoing within these types of workflows. A user will often immediately and in near real time correct the assistant/agent by evaluating the output. Additional agents could be added similarly to autonomous agents for more extensive collaborative workflows.
- *Game AI*—Evaluation will often be broken down into development evaluation— evaluating how the agent interacts with the game—and in-game evaluation, evalu- ating how well an agent succeeded at a task. Implementing the later evaluation form is similar to autonomous agents but aims to improve some strategies or execution. Such in-game evaluations would also likely benefit from memory and a means of feedback.
- *Research*—Evaluation at this level generally occurs as a manual effort after com- pleting the research task. An agent could employ some form of evaluation simi- lar to autonomous agents to improve the generated output, perhaps even contemplating internally how evaluation of the output could be extended or further researched. Because this is currently a new area for agentic develop- ment, how well this will be executed remains to be seen.
Evaluation is an essential element to any agentic or assistant system, especially if that system provides real and fundamental information to users. Developing evaluation sys- tems for agents and assistants is likely something that could or should have its own book. In the final section of this chapter, we’ll look at feedback implementation for various LLM applications.

# 11.5.4 Application of feedback to agentic/assistant applications

Feedback as a component of agentic systems is often, if not always, implemented as an external component—at least for now. Perhaps confidence in evaluation systems may improve to the point where feedback is regularly incorporated into such sys- tems. Table 11.4 showcases how feedback can be implemented into various LLM applications.

<!-- Page 318 -->

Table 11.4 shows several application scenarios in which we may find an assistant or agent

deployed to assist in some capacity. To provide further information and guidance, this list provides more details about how feedback may be employed in each application:

- *Personal assistant*—If the assistant or agent interacts with the user in a chat-style interface, direct and immediate feedback can be applied by the user. Whether this feedback is sustained over future conversations or interactions, it usually develops within agentic memory. Assistants such as ChatGPT now incorporate memory and can benefit from explicit user feedback.
- *Customer service bot*—User or system feedback is typically provided through a survey after the interaction has completed. This usually means that feedback is regulated to an external system that aggregates the feedback for later improvements.
- *Autonomous agent*—Much like bots, feedback within autonomous agents is typi- cally regulated to after the agent has completed a task that a user then reviews. The feedback mechanism may be harder to capture because many things can

<!-- Page 319 -->

***11.5 Applying planning, reasoning, evaluation, and feedback to assistant and agentic sys-*295** be subjective. Methods explored in this chapter for producing feedback can be used within prompt engineering improvements.
- *Collaborative workflows*—Similar to the personal assistant, these types of appli- cations can benefit from immediate and direct feedback from the user. Again, how this information is persisted across sessions is often an implementation of agentic memory.
- *Game AI*—Feedback can be implemented alongside evaluation through addi- tional and multiple agents. This feedback form may again be single-use and exist within the current interaction or may persist as memory. Imagine a game AI that can evaluate its actions, improve those with feedback, and remember those improvements. While this pattern isn’t ideal for games, it will certainly improve the gameplay experience.
- *Research*—Similar to evaluation in the context of research, feedback is typically performed offline after the output is evaluated. While some development has been done using multiple agent systems incorporating agents for evaluation and feedback, these systems don’t always perform well, at least not with the cur- rent state-of-the-art models. Instead, it’s often better to isolate feedback and evaluation at the end to avoid the common feedback looping problem.
Feedback is another powerful component of agentic and assistant systems, but it’s not always required on the first release. However, incorporating rigorous feedback and evaluation mechanisms can greatly benefit agentic systems in the long term concern- ing ongoing monitoring and providing the confidence to improve various aspects of the system. How you implement each of these components in your agentic systems may, in part, be guided by the architecture of your chosen agentic platform. Now that you understand the nuances of each component, you also have the knowledge to guide you in selecting the right agent system that fits your application and business use case. Regardless of your application, you’ll want to employ several agentic components in almost all cases. As agentic systems mature and LLMs themselves get smarter, some of the compo- nents we today consider external may be closely integrated. We’ve already seen rea- soning and planning be integrated into a model such as Strawberry. Certainly, as we approach the theoretical artificial general intelligence milestone, we may see models capable of performing long-term self-evaluation and feedback. In any case, I hope you enjoyed this journey with me into this incredible frontier of a new and emerging technology that will certainly alter our perception of work and how we undertake it through agents.

# 11.6 Exercises

Use the following exercises to improve your knowledge of the material:

- *Exercise 1*—Implement a Simple Planning Agent (Beginner) *Objective*—Learn how to implement a basic planning agent using a prompt to generate a sequence of actions. *Tasks:* – Create an agent that receives a goal, breaks it into steps, and executes those steps sequentially. – Define a simple goal, such as retrieving information from Wikipedia and sav- ing it to a file. – Implement the agent using a basic planner prompt (refer to the planner example in section 11.3). – Run the agent, and evaluate how well it plans and executes each step.
- *Exercise 2*—Test Feedback Integration in a Planning Agent (Intermediate) *Objective*—Understand how feedback mechanisms can improve the performance of an agentic system. *Tasks:* – Modify the agent from exercise 1 to include a feedback loop after each task. – Use the feedback to adjust or correct the next task in the sequence. – Test the agent by giving it a more complex task, such as gathering data from multiple sources, and observe how the feedback improves its performance. – Document and compare the agent’s behavior before and after adding feedback.
- *Exercise 3*—Experiment with Parallel and Sequential Planning (Intermediate) *Objective*—Learn the difference between parallel and sequential actions and how they affect agent behavior. *Tasks:* – Set up two agents using Nexus: one that executes tasks in parallel and another that performs tasks sequentially. – Define a multistep goal where some actions depend on the results of previous actions (sequential), and some can be done simultaneously (parallel). – Compare the performance and output of both agents, noting any errors or inefficiencies in parallel execution when sequential steps are required.
- *Exercise 4*—Build and Integrate a Custom Planner into Nexus (Advanced) *Objective*—Learn how to build a custom planner and integrate it into an agent platform. *Tasks:* – Write a custom planner using prompt engineering strategies from section 11.3, ensuring it supports sequential task execution. – Integrate this planner into Nexus, and create an agent that uses it.

<!-- Page 321 -->

***Summary* 297**

– Test the planner with a complex goal that involves multiple steps and tools (e.g., data retrieval, processing, and saving). – Evaluate how the custom planner performs compared to built-in planners in Nexus or other platforms.

- *Exercise 5*—Implement Error Handling and Feedback in Sequential Planning (Advanced) *Objective*—Learn how to implement error handling and feedback to refine sequen- tial planning in an agentic system. *Tasks:* – Using a sequential planner, set up an agent to perform a goal that may encoun- ter common errors (e.g., a failed API call, missing data, or invalid input). – Implement error-handling mechanisms in the planner to recognize and respond to these errors. – Add feedback loops to adjust the plan or retry actions based on the error encountered. – Test the system by deliberately causing errors during execution, and observe how the agent recovers or adjusts its plan.
# Summary

- Planning is central to agents and assistants, allowing them to take a goal, break it into steps, and execute them. Without planning, agents are reduced to simple chatbot-like interactions.
- Agents must differentiate between parallel and sequential actions. Many LLMs can handle parallel actions, but only advanced models support sequential plan- ning, critical for complex task completion.
- Feedback is crucial in guiding agents to correct their course and improve per- formance over time. This chapter demonstrates how feedback mechanisms can be integrated with agents to refine their decision-making processes.
- Platforms such as OpenAI Assistants and Anthropic’s Claude support internal planning and can execute complex, multistep tasks. Agents using these plat- forms can use sequential action planning for sophisticated workflows.
- Properly selecting and limiting agent actions is vital to avoid confusion and unintended behavior. Too many actions may overwhelm an agent, while unnec- essary tools may be misused.
- Nexus allows for creating and managing agents through a flexible interface, where users can implement custom planners, set goals, and assign tools. The chapter includes practical examples using Nexus to highlight the difference between a raw LLM and a planner-enhanced agent.
- Writing custom planners is straightforward, using prompt engineering strate- gies. Tools such as LangChain and Semantic Kernel offer a variety of planners that can be adapted or extended to fit specific agentic needs.

<!-- Page 322 -->

**298** CHAPTER 11 ***Agent planning and feedback***

- Models such as OpenAI Strawberry integrate reasoning, planning, evalua- tion, and feedback directly into the LLM, offering more accurate problem- solving capabilities.
- Evaluation helps determine how well an agentic system is performing and can be implemented internally or externally, depending on the use case.
- As LLMs evolve, reasoning, planning, and feedback mechanisms may become deeply integrated into models, paving the way for more autonomous and intelli- gent agent systems.

# appendix A Accessing OpenAI

# large language models

Although several commercial large language model (LLM) services are available, this book recommends using OpenAI services directly or through Azure OpenAI Studio. To access either service, you must create an account and register a payment method not covered in this appendix. The GPT-4 family of LLMs is considered best in class and better suited for agent development. Using open source and alterna- tive services is always an option but generally only advisable after you’ve worked with GPT-4 for some time.

## A.1 Accessing OpenAI accounts and keys

The following general steps can help you quickly set up using OpenAI LLMs for agent development. Though using OpenAI and other commercial LLMs comes at a price, you can expect to pay less than US$100 to complete all the exercises in this book:

1 Go to [https://openai.com](https://openai.com) and log in, or register for an account and log in. If this is your first time creating an account, you’ll likely be given free credit in some amount. If you already have an account, you must register a payment method and type. It’s generally better to purchase a number of credits at a time. This will allow you to manage the costs better and avoid overruns. 2 After logging in to the platform, select ChatGPT or the API, as shown in figure A.1. Choose the API.

5 Copy and paste the key to a notepad or another area for safekeeping using the Copy button, as shown in figure A.4. Keep this key secret, and ensure it remains only on your development machine.

After generating a key, you can continue to use it within an .env configuration file or through other means of registering an OpenAI key. For most of the packages used in this book, configuring OpenAI will generally only require the key. Other services, such as Azure OpenAI, will require the configuration of a model deployment and a base URL as covered in the next section.

# A.2 Azure OpenAI Studio, keys, and deployments

Through its ongoing relationship with OpenAI, Microsoft hosts the same models at the same price within Azure OpenAI Studio. Occasionally, Azure may be a model ver- sion behind, but Microsoft generally keeps current with the latest OpenAI models. These guidelines will be more general because there are several ways to access Azure and methods of creating accounts and accessing the studio (for specific instruc- tions, refer to Microsoft documentation):

1 Log in to your Azure portal account subscription. 2 Create a new Azure OpenAI Studio resource in a region that makes sense to you. At the time of writing, not all regions provided access to all models. You may need to check which models are available for your region first. This will also be specific to your account and usage. Within Azure OpenAI, models are exposed through a resource allocation called a *deployment*. Deployments wrap a model, such as GPT-4, and provide access to the resource. Figure A.5 shows an example of various models being exposed through deployments. 3 Click the Create New Deployment button to create a new deployment, and then select the model you want to deploy.

<!-- Page 327 -->

***A.2 Azure OpenAI Studio, keys, and deployments* 303**
**Deployment name is the name OpenAI model Other resource referenced as the model name. name information**

Figure A.5 Deploying a model through an Azure OpenAI Studio deployment

4 After the model is wrapped in a deployment, you must access the parent Azure OpenAI resource. From there, you can access the key, endpoint, or base URL needed to configure your connection, as shown in figure A.6. Again, if you get stuck, the Microsoft documentation can guide you in the right direc- tion. The three critical differences to remember when connecting to a resource such as Azure OpenAI Studio or another LLM using the OpenAI tooling are listed here:

- The api key to access the model
- The base url or endpoint where the model is located
- The name of the model or deployment name
If you can’t access a model for whatever reason, a good alternative is open source models. Setting up and consuming open source LLMs is covered in chapter 2.

# appendix B Python development

*environment*

While this book assumes readers are experienced Python developers, this could mean many different things. In this appendix, we look at configuring a Python development environment that will function with the code examples in this book. You can use other integrated development environments (IDEs), but not all tool- ing, especially extensions, will work in all IDEs.

## B.1 Downloading the source code

To download and run the source code, install Git, and then pull the repository locally. Here are the high-level steps to pull the code from the book’s GitHub repository:

1 Install Git if you need to. Git can be installed from multiple sources, but a good option is the main release, found here: [https://git-scm.com/down-](https://git-scm.com/down-) loads. Follow the instructions to download and install the tool for your oper- ating system. 2 Open a terminal in a folder you want to download the source to, and then enter the following command:

git clone [https://github.com/cxbxmxcx/GPT-Agents.git](https://github.com/cxbxmxcx/GPT-Agents.git)

3 After the code is downloaded, you can begin by opening the chapter folder that you’re working on in Visual Studio Code (VS Code). If you need to

<!-- Page 330 -->

**306** APPENDIX B ***Python development environment***

install VS Code or understand how to load a chapter folder as a workspace, con- sult section B.5 in this appendix.

# B.2 Installing Python

Python is provided through different versions and deployments. This book relies on the standard Python installation, version 3.10. Anaconda is another deployment of Python that is very popular and could be used. However, all the material in this book has been run and tested with a Python 3.10 virtual environment:

1 Go to www.python.org/downloads/. 2 Locate and download the latest release of Python 3.10 for your operating system. 3 Install the release on your machine using the instructions for your operating system. 4 To confirm your installation, open a terminal, and execute the following command:

python –-version

The version should be 3.10, but if it isn’t, don't worry. You may have multiple Python versions installed. We’ll also confirm the installation when setting up VS Code.

# B.3 Installing VS Code

Installing VS Code is relatively straightforward and can be done in just a few steps:

1 Go to [https://code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com). 2 Download a stable release of VS Code for your operating system. 3 After the release is downloaded, follow the installation instructions for your operating system. 4 Launch VS Code for your operating system, and make sure no warnings or errors appear. If you encounter problems, try to restart your computer and/or reinstall.

With VS Code running, we can install the necessary extensions. We’ll cover those extensions next.

# B.4 Installing VS Code Python extensions

Thousands of extensions for VS Code can provide an excellent Python coding envi- ronment. The recommended ones are only the start of what you can explore inde- pendently. Beware, though, that not all extensions are created equally. When installing new extensions, look at the number of installs and ratings. Extensions with fewer than four stars are generally to be avoided. To install the extensions, follow these steps:

<!-- Page 331 -->

***B.4 Installing VS Code Python extensions* 307**
1 Launch VS Code, and open the Extensions panel, as shown in figure B.1.

**Enter your search term.**

**Open the Click the Install** **Extensions panel.** **Select the button to install.** **extensions.** Figure B.1 Installing VS Code extensions

2 Install the following list of extensions: – Python, for environment and language support – Python Extension Pack, for covering other extensions – Python Environment Manager, for managing environments – Python Indent, for code formatting – Flake8, for code formatting/linting – Prompt Flow, for testing LLM prompts – Semantic Kernel Tools, for working with the Semantic Kernel framework – Docker, for managing Docker containers – Dev Containers, for running development environments with containers You’ll only need to install the extensions for each VS Code environment you’re run- ning. Typically, this will mean installing for just your operating system installation of VS Code. However, if you run VS Code in containers, you must install extensions for each container you’re running. Working with Python in the Dev Containers extension will be covered later in this appendix.

<!-- Page 332 -->

**308** APPENDIX B ***Python development environment***

# B.5 Creating a new Python environment with VS Code

When developing Python projects, you often want to create isolated virtual environ- ments. This will help in managing multiple package dependencies across various tasks and tools. In this book, it’s recommended that a new virtual environment be created for each new chapter. VS Code can help you create and manage multiple Python envi- ronments quickly and efficiently via the following steps: 1 Press Ctrl-Shift-P (Cmd-Shift-P) to open the command panel, and select Python: Create Environment, as shown in figure B.2.

**Open the command panel (Ctrl-Shift-P, Cmd-Shift-P)**

**Select to create a new environment.** **Select the type of environment. The instructions in this book use an .venv** **environment, but Conda should work just as well.**

**Use the Refresh button if your installation is shown.**

**Select the installation. This list should reflect the Python versions you have installed.**

**Check the requirements.txt file, which should contain all the dependencies for the chapter.**

Figure B.2 The steps to set up the virtual environment for a chapter

2 Select the environment type, either Venv or Conda. This book demonstrates Venv but Conda should also work.

<!-- Page 333 -->

***B.6 Using VS Code Dev Containers (Docker)* 309**
3 Select the Python installation. The code in this book has been run with Python

3.10 at a minimum. The agent tools and frameworks featured in this book are cutting edge, so they should support later versions of Python.
4 Check that the requirements.txt file in the chapter folder is selected. This will install all the requirements for the current chapter.

You should complete these steps for each new chapter of the book. The alternative is to use VS Code development containers, which will be covered in the next section.

# B.6 Using VS Code Dev Containers (Docker)

When working with advanced agents and agents that can generate and execute code, running them in isolated containers is generally recommended. Container isolation prevents operating system disruption or corruption and provides a base for deploying agents. Getting familiar with containers and platforms such as Docker can be an extensive undertaking to grasp everything. Fortunately, it takes very little knowledge to start using containers, and VS Code extensions make this even more accessible. You’ll first need to install a container toolset. Docker is free (provided you use the tool as a hobby or you’re a student) and the most accessible. Follow these instructions to install Docker and get started working with containers:

1 Go to the Docker Desktop download page at www.docker.com/products/ docker-desktop. 2 Download and install Docker for your operating system. Follow any other instructions as requested. 3 Launch the Docker desktop application. Completing this step will confirm you have Docker installed and working as expected. 4 Open VS Code, and confirm that the Docker extensions listed in section 1.4 are installed.

With Docker and VS Code configured, you can move on to using Dev Containers by following these steps:

1 Open a new instance of VS Code. 2 Select to open a remote window, as shown in figure B.3. 3 Select Open Folder in Container to start a container from a folder, or select New Dev Container to start without a folder. After the container is launched, your VS Code environment will be con- nected. This allows you to develop code on the container without worrying about dependencies not working.

## AI AgentsIN ACTION

#### Micheal Lanham

ost production AI systems require many orchestrated interactions between the user, AI models, and a wide

# Mvariety of data sources. AI agents capture and organize

these interactions into autonomous components that can pro- cess information, make decisions, and learn from interactions behind the scenes. Th is book will show you how to create AI agents and connect them together into powerful multi-agent systems.

In **AI Agents in Action**, you’ll learn how to build production -ready assistants, multi-agent systems, and behavioral agents. You’ll master the essential parts of an agent, including retrieval-augmented knowledge and memory, while you create multi-agent applications that can use software tools, plan tasks autonomously, and learn from experience. As you explore the many interesting examples, you’ll work with state-of-the-art tools like OpenAI Assistants API, GPT Nexus, LangChain, Prompt Flow, AutoGen, and CrewAI.

### What’s Inside

● Knowledge management and memory systems ● Feedback loops for continuous agent learning ● Collaborative multi-agent systems ● Speech and computer vision

##### For intermediate Python programmers.

**Micheal Lanham** is a software and technology innovator with over 20 years of industry experience. He has authored books on deep learning, including Manning’s *Evolutionary Deep* *Learning*.

Th e technical editor on this book was Ross Turner.

For print book owners, all digital formats are free: [https://www.manning.com/freebook](https://www.manning.com/freebook)
